<p class="in0">“... <i>But, beside those great men, there is a certain
number of artists who have a distinct faculty
of their own by which they convey to us a peculiar
quality of pleasure which we cannot get elsewhere;
and these, too, have their place in general
culture, and must be interpreted to it by those who
have felt their charm strongly, and are often the
objects of a special diligence and a consideration
wholly affectionate, just because there is not about
them the stress of a great name and authority.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> book was written while on holiday some three
thousand miles away from data, documents, and means
of verification. It is written from memory and, although
I have had time and have tried to check up, I
feel sure that the safest thing is to let it go as cautious
merchants do when they send out statements—with
the <i>caveat</i>: E. and O. E.—errors and omissions excepted.
I haven’t tried to write a history of any of
the lively arts, nor intended to mention all of those
who practice them. I should, however, feel sorry if
I have omitted anyone who has given me intense
pleasure, even though the omission has not, in any
way, the countenance of a slur.</p>

<p>Everything else that properly belongs in a preface
has found its way into the two chapters: <i>The Great
God Bogus</i> and <i>Before a Picture by Picasso</i>—and the
acknowledgments are numerous and serious enough to
need a place for themselves in the appendix.</p>

<p><i>For fifteen years there has existed in the
United States, and in the United States alone, a
form of entertainment which, seemingly without
sources in the past, restored to us a kind of
laughter almost unheard in modern times. It
came into being by accident; it had no pretensions
to art. For ten years or more it added an
element of cheerful madness to the lives of millions
and was despised and rejected by people of
culture and intelligence. Suddenly—suddenly
as it appeared to them—a great genius arose and
the people of culture conceded that in his case,
but in his case alone, art existed in slap-stick comedy;
they did not remove their non expedit from
the form itself.</i></p>

<p><i>Perhaps only those of us who care for the rest
know how good Charlie is. Perhaps only the inexpressive
multitudes who have laughed and not
wondered why they laughed can know how fine
slap-stick is. For myself, I have had no greater
entertainment than these dear and preposterous
comedies, and all I can do is remember. The long,
dark, narrow passage set out with uncomfortable
chairs; the sharp almond odours, the sense of uncertainty,
and the questionable piano; and then
upon the screen, in a drab grey and white, jiggling
insecurely, something strange and wonderful
occurred. It was mingled with dull and stupid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
things; but it had a fire, a driving energy of its
own—and it was funny! Against all our inhibitions
and habits it played games with men and
women; it made them ridiculous and mad; it
seemed to have no connexion with the logic of
human events, trusting to an undecipherable logic
of its own. A few scholars found the commedia
dell’arte living again; a few artists saw that the
galvanic gestures and movements were creating
fresh lines and interesting angles. And a nation
cared for them intensely until the remorseless hostility
of the genteel began to corrupt the purity
of slap-stick. That is where we are now: too early
to write an epitaph—late enough to pay a tribute.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Lest</span> the year 1914 should be not otherwise distinguished
in history, it may be recorded that it was then,
or a year earlier, or possibly a year later, that the turning
point came in the history of the American moving
picture. The first of the great mergers arrived—an
event not unforeseen in itself, a “logical development”
the press agents called it—seeming to establish the picture
as a definitely accepted form of entertainment. It
was a moment when a good critic might have foretold
the course of the moving picture during the next
decade, for at that time the Triangle of Fine Arts
(D. W. Griffith), Kay-Bee (Thomas H. Ince), and
Keystone (Mack Sennett) was formed. Two of these
names were already known, and of the two one was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
become, for a time, the most notable name in the profession;
the third was hidden behind the obscure symbol
of the Keystone; it represented one who had acted
in, and was now directing, the most despised, and by
all odds the most interesting, films produced in America.
Mr Griffith was already entered on that road
which has since ruined him as a director; he was producing
<i>Intolerance</i>, and, if I may borrow a phrase from
the Shuberts, his personal supervision was not always
given to the Triangle-Fine Arts releases; Mr Ince was
presently to meditate upon the possibility of joining
the word “super” to the word “spectacle,” thus creating
the word “superspectacle”; and Mr Sennett—by
a process of exclusion one always arrives at
Mr Sennett. He is the Keystone the builders rejected.</p>

<p>I know nothing more doleful as a subject of conversation
than the social-economics of the moving picture;
what was remarkable about the Triangle was not
its new method of distribution, its new hold on the
timid exhibitor, or its capacity for making or losing
fortunes. The thing to note is that the two “serious”
producers, and the hard-headed business men who
invested money in their efforts, thought it well to
associate with themselves the best producer of vulgar
slap-stick comedy. More than that, they combined
in a peculiar ratio for the scheme provided that there
was to be released each week either a Fine Arts or an
Ince picture; and that with each of these was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
shown a Keystone comedy. So that those who were
perpetually being caught in the rain, or missing the
eleven-o’clock from Philadelphia to New York, saw
twice as many Keystone comedies as (a) Fine Arts
or (b) Kay-Bee releases. The recent all-hailing of
Mr Chaplin as an artist because of his work in <i>The
Kid</i>, the bright young reputations of Harold Lloyd
and Buster Keaton, indicate that most critics of the
moving picture caught the train and missed the shower.
They certainly missed the comedies; for the Fine Arts
and Ince pictures were in their time the best pictures
produced; and the Keystone comedies were consistently
and almost without exception better.</p>

<p>This is not the place to discuss the shortcomings of
the feature film; for the moment, let the dreadful
opulent gentility of a Cecil De Mille production serve
only to sharpen the saucy gaiety of the comic, the dulness
of a Universal set off the revelry of slap-stick.
There is one serious point which a good critic (Aristotle,
for example) would have discovered when he
regarded the screen as long ago as 1914 and became
aware of the superiority of the comic films. He would
have seen at once that while Mr Griffith and Mr Ince
were both developing the technique of the moving
picture, they were exploiting their discoveries with
materials equally or better suited to another medium:
the stage or the dime novel or whatever. Whereas
Mr Sennett was already so enamoured of his craft
that he was doing with the instruments of the moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
picture precisely those things which were best suited
to it—those things which could not be done with any
instrument but the camera, and could appear nowhere
if not on the screen.</p>

<p>This does not mean that nothing but slap-stick
comedy is proper to the cinema; it means only that
everything in slap-stick <i>is</i> cinematographic; and since
perceiving a delicate adjustment of means to end,
or a proper relation between method and material,
is a source of pleasure, Mr Sennett’s developments
were more capable of pleasing the judicious than
those of either of his two fellow-workers. The
highly logical humanist critic of the films could have
foreseen in 1914—without the decade of trial and
error which has intervened—what we see now: that
the one field in which the picture would most notably
declare itself a failure would be that of the drama
(Elinor Glyn-Cecil De Mille-Gilbert Parker, in
short). Without a moment’s hesitation he would
have put his finger on those two elements in the
cinema which, being theoretically sound, had a chance
of practical success: the spectacle (including the
spectacular melodrama) and the grotesque comedy.
Several years later he would have added one word
more, that grotesque tragedy might conceivably succeed.
For it is not only the fun in the Keystones
which makes them successful: it is the method of
presentation.</p>

<p>The rightness of the spectacle film is implicit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
in its name: the screen is a place on which things
can be <i>seen</i>, and so long as a film depends upon the
eye it is right for the screen—and whether it is right
in any other regard depends upon taste and judgment
and skill. Omit as irrelevant the news reels,
animated cartoons, educational and travel films—all
of them good; omit equally those printed jokes
and clippings from the <i>Literary Digest</i> which are
at once the greatest trial <i>and</i> error of the screen.
What remains? The feature film and <i>The Cabinet
of Dr Caligari</i>. This—the only film of high fantasy
I have ever seen—is the seeming exception which
proves the rule, since it owes its success to the skilfully
concealed exploitation of the materials and
technique of the spectacle and of the comic film, and
not to the dramatic quality of its story. The studio
settings in distortion represent the spectacle; they
are variations of scenery or “location”; the chase
over the roofs is a psychological parallel to the
Keystone cops; and the weak moment of this superb
picture is that in which the moving picture always
fails, in the double revelation at the end, like that of
<i>Seven Keys to Baldpate</i>, representing “drama.”</p>

<p>No. The drama film is almost always wrong,
the slap-stick almost always right; and it is divinely
just that the one great figure of the screen should
have risen out of the Keystone studios. He came
too early; Chaplin spoiled nearly everything else
for us, and he is always used by those who dislike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
slap-stick to prove their case. Their case, regrettably,
is in a fair way to be proved, for slap-stick is in
danger. The hypothetical critic mentioned above has
not yet occurred; Mr Bushnell Dimond, the best
actual critic of the movies, is without sympathy for
Mack Sennett and calls him a Bourbon, in the sense
of one who forgets nothing and learns less. What
Mr Sennett has needed long since is encouragement
and criticism; and stupid newspaper critics (who
write half-columns about a new Gloria Swanson picture
and add “the comedy which ends the bill is
<i>Down in the Sewer</i>”) have left slap-stick wholly
without direction.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> At the same time the tradition
of gentility, the hope of being “refined,” has touched
the grotesque comedy; its directors have heard abuse
and sly remarks about custard pies so long that they
have begun to believe in them, and the madness which
is a monstrous sanity in the movie comedy is likely to
die out. The moving picture is being prettified;
the manufacturers and exhibitors are growing more
and more pretentious, and the riot of slap-stick
seems out of place in a “presentation” which begins
with the overture to <i>Tannhäuser</i>, and includes a
baritone from the imperial opera house in Warsaw
singing <i>Indian Love Lyrics</i> in front of an art curtain.
In Paris there are one or two Chaplin films
visible nearly every day; in New York the Rialto
Theatre alone seems to make a habit of Chaplin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
revivals and of putting its comic feature in the
electric sign. The Capitol, the largest, and rapidly
becoming the most genteel, of moving picture palaces
(but who ever heard of an opera palace?) frequently
announces a programme of seven or eight items without
a comedy among them; and you have to go to
squalid streets and disreputable neighborhoods if
you want to see Chaplin regularly. He could ask
for no finer tribute, to be sure; but it is not much
to our credit that the greatest mimic of our time has
no theatre named after him, that it was in Berlin,
not in Chicago or New York, that the first Chaplin
festival took place, and that <i>Tillie’s Punctured
Romance</i>, a film intensely important in his development,
was last billed in a converted auction room
on the lower East Side of New York, where Broadway
would find it vulgar.</p>

<p>There were always elements in the Keystone
which jeopardized its future—it lacked variety, it
was often dull, its lapses of taste were serious. (I
transfer the name of Keystone to the <i>genre</i> of which
it was the most notable example; it was for long,
and may still be, superior to most of the others.)
But, while there is still time, its miraculously good
qualities can be caught and possibly preserved. The
ideal comedy of Mack Sennett is a fairly standardized
article; too much so, perhaps, but the elements
are sound. They include a simple, usually preposterous
plot, frequently a burlesque of a serious play;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
more important are the characters, grotesque in bulk,
form, or make-up; and, finally, the events which
have as little connexion with the plot as, say, a clog
dance in a musical comedy. In the early days of
the Keystone, it is said, the plot was almost nonexistent
in advance, and developed out of the set and
the props. The one which was called, in revival,
<i>The Pile Driver</i>, must have been such a film, for
its plot is that two men meet a pretty girl near a
river and they find a huge mallet. It is a film full
of impromptus—not very brilliant ones, as a matter
of fact—in which Sennett and Chaplin and Mabel
Normand each occasionally give flashes of their qualities.
A few years later you see the same thing when
the trick of working up a film from the material in
hand has become second nature. <i>His Night Out</i>
presents Ben Turpin and Charlie Chaplin as equal
comedians: two men on a drinking party, stumbling
into a luxurious hotel, reverting automatically to
the saloon from which they have been thrown, mutually
assisting and hindering each other in a serious
effort to do something they cannot define, but which
they feel to be of cosmic importance. Later, one
finds a more sophisticated kind of comic. <i>Bright
Eyes</i> has to do with a gawky young man, reputed
rich, received into a wealthy family, engaged to the
daughter, denounced as an impostor, reduced to the
kitchen, flirting there with the maid, restored to
favour, and, nobly refusing the daughter’s hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
marrying the maid. Here Ben Turpin had good
moments, but much of the gaiety of the film depended
upon Chester Conklin (or one who much
resembles him) as another servant in the house, bundling
himself up in furs like Peary in the Arctic,
bidding farewell at an imaginary outpost of civilization,
and striding into—a huge refrigerator, to bring
back a ham before the adoring eyes of the cook.</p>

<p>The comic film is by nature adventurous and romantic,
and I think what endears it to us is that the
adventure is picaresque and the romance wholly unsentimental—that
is, both are pushed to the edge of
burlesque. For the romance you have a love affair,
frequently running parallel to a parody of itself.
The hero is marked by peculiarities of his own:
the Chaplin feet, the Hank Mann bang and sombre
eyes, the Turpin squint, the Arbuckle bulk; against
these oddities and absurdities plays the serene, idle
beauty of a simple girl (Edna Purviance or Mabel
Normand in her lovely early days), and only on
occasions a comic in her own right like Louise Fazenda
or Polly Moran. In some five hundred slap-stick
comedies I do not remember one single moment
of sentimentality; and it seems to me that every look
and gesture of false chivalry and exaggerated devotion
has been parodied there. The characteristic
moment, after all, is when the comedy is ended,
and just as the hero is about to kiss the heroine
he winks broadly and ironically at the spectators.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Our whole tradition of love is destroyed and outraged
in these careless comedies; so also our tradition
of heroism. And since the moving picture, quite
naturally, began by importing the whole baggage
of the romantic and sentimental novel and theatre,
the moving-picture comedy has at last arrived at
burlesquing its silly-serious half-sister. Two years
before <i>Merton of the Movies</i> appeared, Mack
Sennett, with the help of Ben Turpin’s divinely
crossed eyes, had consummated a burlesque of Messrs
Griffith, Ince, and Lubitsch, in <i>A Small Town Idol</i>,
far more destructively, be it said, than Chaplin in his
<i>Carmen</i>, and with a vaster fun than <i>Merton</i>.</p>

<p>Everything incongruous and inconsequent has its
place in the unrolling of the comic film: love and masquerade
and treachery; coincidence and disguise;
heroism and knavishness; all are distorted, burlesqued,
exaggerated. And—here the camera enters—all are
presented at an impossible rate; the culmination is
in the inevitable struggle and the conventional pursuit,
where trick photography enters and you see
the immortal Keystone cops in their flivver, mowing
down hundreds of telegraph poles without abating
their speed, dashing through houses or losing their
wheels and continuing, blown to bits and reassembled
in midair; locomotives running wild, yet never destroying
the cars they so miraculously send spinning
before them; airplanes and submarines in and out
of their elements—everything capable of motion set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
into motion; and at the height of the revel, the true
catastrophe, the solution of the preposterous and forgotten
drama, with the lovers united under the canopy
of smashed motor cars, or the gay feet of Mr
Chaplin gently twinkling down the irised street.</p>

<p>And all of this is done <i>with the camera, through
action</i> presented to the eye. The secret of distortion
is in the camera, and the secret of pace in the projector.
Regard them for a moment, regard the slap-stick
as every moment explains itself, and then go to
the picture palace and spend one-third of your time
reading the flamboyancies of C. Gardner Sullivan
and another third watching the contortions of a famous
actress as she “registers” an emotion which action
and photography should present directly, and you
will see why the comic film is superior. There is
virtually no registering in the comedy, there is no
senseless pantomime, and the titles are succinct and
few. In <i>Bright Eyes</i>, as the marriage of convenience
is about to take place, the mother sweeps in with
these words, “Faint quick—he’s dead broke.” An
absurd letter or telegram is introduced to set the
play going; the rest is literally silence.</p>

<p>What I have said about Chaplin regards him as
a typical slap-stick comedian.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The form would have
succeeded without him and he has passed beyond the
form entirely. The other practitioners of the art
come out of his shadow, and some of them are excellent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
What makes Chaplin great is that he has irony
and pity, he knows that you must not have the one
without the other; he has both piety and wit. Next
to him, for his work in <i>His Bread and Butter</i> and a
few other films, stands Hank Mann, who translates
the childlike gravity of Chaplin into a frightened innocence,
a serious endeavour to understand the world
which seems always hostile to him. He was trained,
I have been told, as a tragic actor on the East Side
of New York, and he seems always stricken with the
cruelty and madness of an existence in which he alone
is logical and sane. If he, walking backward to
get a last glimpse of his beloved (after “A Waiter’s
Farewell,” as the caption has it), steps on the running
board of a motor instead of a street car, he is
willing to pay the usual fare and let bygones be bygones.
His black bang almost meets his eyes, and
his eyes are mournful and piteous; his gesture is slow
and rounded; a few of the ends of the world have
come upon his head and the eyelids are a little weary.
He is the Wandering Jew misdirected into comic life
by an unscrupulous fate.</p>

<p>His most notable opposite is Harold Lloyd, a
man of no tenderness, of no philosophy, the embodiment
of American cheek and indefatigable energy.
His movements are all direct, straight; the
shortest distance between two points he will traverse
impudently and persistently, even if he is knocked
down at the end of each trip; there is no poetry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in him, his whole utterance being epigrammatic,
without overtone or image. Yet once, at least, he
too stepped into that lunatic Arcadia to which his
spirit is alien; not in <i>Grandma’s Boy</i>, which might
just as well have been done by Charles Ray, but in
<i>A Sailor-made Man</i>. Here the old frenzy fell upon
him, the weakling won by guile, and instead of fighting
one man he laid out a mob from behind; something
excessive, topsy-turvy, riotous at last occurred
in his ordered existence. He is funny; but he has no
vulgarity; he is smart. He amuses me without making
me laugh, and I figure him as a step toward
gentility.</p>

<p>Ben Turpin has progressed, fortunately without
taking that step. In <i>Bright Eyes</i> he was mildly
absurd; in <i>His Night Out</i>, with Chaplin, he was tremendously
funny; and what he learned there of the
lesson of the master he imported into his private
masterpiece, <i>A Small Town Idol</i>. Like Chaplin, he
disarms you and endears himself; unlike him, and
often to Turpin’s advantage, he knows how to be
ridiculous. One always sees Chaplin’s impersonations
as they see themselves. Is he a count or a pretender,
or an English gentleman, or a policeman, or a tramp,
the character is completely embodied; Chaplin never
makes fun of himself. The process of identification
is complete and, apart from the interest and the fun
of the action, your chief pleasure is in awaiting the
inevitable denunciation. Ben Turpin, who has only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
a talent for Chaplin’s genius, makes the most of it and
lets you see through him. His exaggerations do more
than reveal—they betray, and above all they betray
the fact that Turpin is aware of the absurdities of his
characters; you see them objectively, and through
him you see through them.</p>

<p>When he returns home as the Wild West screen
hero, and his own picture is shown before those who
so recently had despised him, his deprecating gesture
before the screen on which his exploits are being
shown is so broad, so simple-silly, that it is more
than a description of himself as he thinks it is, and
lets us perceive his absurdity. He is exactly a zany.</p>

<p>Three other buffoons of the old Keystone days
retain their capacity to be amusing: the galvanic,
jack-in-the-box, Al St John; Mack Swain, and Chester
Conklin; they are exactly as they were ten years
ago, and one fancies they will never be great. The
difficult person to be sure about is Buster Keaton,
who came to the pictures from vaudeville, and has
carried into his new medium his greatest asset, an
enormous, incorruptible gravity. He never smiles,
they say, and I have sat through some of his pictures—<i>The
Boat</i>, for one—without seeing any reason why
he should. It was a long mechanical contrivance
with hardly any humour, and was considered a masterpiece;
while <i>The Paleface</i>, in which Keaton played
an entomologist captured by Indians, passed unnoticed.
It had nearly everything a comic needs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
there were certain movements <i>en masse</i>, certain crossings
of the lines of action, which were quite perfect.
Keaton’s intense preoccupation and his hard sense
of personality are excellent. In <i>Cops</i> he took a purely
Keystone subject and multiplied and magnified it to
its last degree of development: thousands of policemen
rushed down one street; equal thousands rushed
up another; and before them fled this small, serious
figure, bent on self-justification, caught in a series
of absurd accidents, wholly law-abiding, a little distracted.
I do not think one will soon forget the
exquisite close of that picture: the whole police force
forming a phalanx, hurled as one body into the courtyard
of the station—and then the little figure which,
having been trapped within, seems doomed to arrest,
coming out, itself accoutred in uniform, and quietly,
quietly locking the huge doors behind it. It, yes; for
by that time Keaton has become wholly impersonal.
So affecting Larry Semon has never been; nor Clyde
Cook; and behind them, but <i>longo intervallo</i>, come
the misguided creatures who make the kind of slap-stick
which most people think Sennett makes. I am
sure there are other good comedians; but I am not
trying to make a catalogue. No one, in any case,
has been able to impose himself as these few have;
and most of the others are so near in method and
manner to these that they require nothing fresh to
be said of them.</p>

<p>It seemed for a moment, in 1922, that if a confessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
murderer were set free by a jury, he or she
went into the movies; but if a moving-picture actor
was declared innocent, he was barred from the screen.
The justice of this I cannot discuss; yet a protest can
be made against the æsthetically high-minded who
said that the real reason for barring the films of
“Fatty” Arbuckle was their vulgarity and their dulness.
For “Fatty” had gone over to a comedy more
refined than slap-stick long before 1922; and in 1914
he was neither stupid nor dull. Once indeed, in
<i>Fatty and Mabel Adrift</i> (Mabel being Miss Normand)
he came near to the best of slap-stick, and the
same picture was as photography and printing, for
sepia seascapes and light and shade, a superior thing
entirely. The fatuous, ingratiating smile was innocent
then, in all conscience, and as for <span class="locked">vulgarity—</span></p>

<p>Let us, before we go to the heart of that question,
look for a moment at the comedy which was always
set against the slap-stick to condemn the custard-pie
school of fun—the comedy of which the best
practitioners were indisputably Mr and Mrs Sidney
Drew. In them there was nothing offensive, except
an enervating dulness. They pretended to be pleasant
episodes in our common life, the life of courtship
and marriage; they accepted all our conventions; and
they were one and all exactly the sort of thing which
the junior class at high school acted when money was
needed to buy a new set of erasers for Miss Struther’s
course in mechanical drawing. The husband stayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
out late at night or was seen kissing a stenographer;
the wife had trouble with a maid or was extravagant
at the best shops; occasionally arrived an ingenuity,
such as the romantic attachment of the wife to anniversaries
contrasted with her husband’s negligence—I
seem to recall that to cure her he brought her a gift
one day in memory of Washington’s birthday. These
things were little stories, not even smoking-room
stories; they were acted entirely in the technique of
the amateur stage; they were incredibly genteel, in
the milieu where “When Baby Came” is genteel;
neither in matter nor in manner did they employ
what the camera and the projector had to give. And,
apart from the agreeable manners of Mr and Mrs
Sidney Drew, nothing made them successful except
the corrupt desire, on the part of the spectators, to
be refined.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort operated in the far better
(feature film) comedies which Douglas Fairbanks
made when he was with Fine Arts. To suit his
physique, they were almost all adventurous; they
were always entertaining. <i>Flirting With Fate</i><a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> presented
a young man who had decided to die and
gave “Automatic Joe,” a gunman, his last fifty dollars
to “bump him off” unexpectedly. Once the
agreement was made, the tide of fortune turned for
the young man, and, desiring earnestly to live, he
felt the paid hand of the assassin always upon his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
shoulder. At the same time the gunman had reformed;
his one object was to return the unearned
fifty dollars. And the cross-purposes, the chase and
flight, were within short distance of high farce. The
comedies of Charles Ray were also unpretentious,
and also used the camera. These and others were
always perfectly decent; but none of them was refined.</p>

<p>And there, essentially, we are back at slap-stick;
for the refined comedy was pretentious, and what is
pretentious is vulgar in any definition of the word;
while slap-stick never pretended to be anything but
itself and could be disgusting or tasteless or dull,
but it could not be vulgar. I consider vulgar the
thing which offends against the canons of taste accepted
by honest people, not by imitative people, not
by snobs. It is equally bad taste, presumably, to
throw custard pies and to commit adultery; but it is
not bad taste to speak of these things. What is intolerable
only is the pretense, and it was against pretentiousness
that the slap-stick comedy had its hardest
fight. It showed a man sitting down on a lighted
gas stove, and it did not hesitate to disclose the underwear
charred at the buttocks which were the logical
consequence of the action. There was never the
slightest suggestion of sexual indecency, or of moral
turpitude, in the Keystones; there was a fuller and
freer use of gesture—gesture with all parts of the
human frame—than we are accustomed to. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
laughter they evoked was broad and long; it was
thoracic, abdominal; it shook us because it was really
the earth trembling beneath our feet. The animal
frankness and health of these pictures constituted
the ground of their offense. And something more.</p>

<p>For the Keystone offended our sense of security
in dull and business-like lives. Few of us imagined
ourselves in the frenzy of action which they set
before us; none of us remained unmoved at the freedom
of fancy, the wildness of imagination, the roaring,
destructive, careless energy which it set loose.
It was an ecstasy of comic life, and in our unecstatic
lives we fled from it to polite comedy, telling ourselves
that what we had seen was ugly and displeasing.
Often it was. I am stating the case for slap-stick,
but I do not wish to make myself responsible
for the millions of feet of stupidity and ugliness
which have been released as comic films. I have seen
Ham and Bud and the imitators of Charlie Chaplin;
I have seen an egg splattered over a man’s face with
such a degree of nauseous ugliness that it seemed
I could never see a comic again. But as like as
not, on the same bill was the James Young screen
version of <i>The Devil</i> with George Arliss, or Geraldine
Farrar in <i>Carmen</i>, or the “<i>‘Affairs of’ Anatol</i>.” And
when people who have seen these “artistic” films, or
the barber-shop scene in a Hitchcock revue or Eddie
Cantor in a dentist’s chair, exclaim (falsely) that
moving-picture comedians do nothing but throw pies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
I am moved to wonder what on earth they are expected
to throw. They are using the eternal materials
of their art, precisely as Aristophanes used them
and Rabelais, with already far too many concessions
to a debased and cowardly and artificial taste. At
the two extremes simple and sophisticated people
have looked directly at the slap-stick screen and
loved it for itself alone; in between are the people
who can see nothing without the lorgnettes of prejudice
provided by fashion and gentility. The simple
ones discovered and prospered the slap-stick screen
long before the sophisticated were aware of its existence;
they took it for what it was and cared nothing
for the fact that it was made by inartistic people
and shown in reeking rooms for a nickel. For long
the poison of culture was powerless to enter; but not
long enough.</p>

<p>I feel moderately certain that the slap-stick
comedy is a good thing for America to have; yet,
being neither an apostle of pagan joy nor a reformer,
I have to put my plea for slap-stick on personal
grounds. It has given me immeasurable entertainment
and I would like to see it saved; I would like
to see a bit more of its impromptus, its unpremeditated
laughter; I would like to do something to banish
the bleak refinement which is setting in upon it.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, in an imaginary conversation, I
made Mr David Wark Griffith announce that he
would produce <i>Helen of Troy</i>, and I made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
defend the Keystone comedy. It seemed to me then
as now that there is nothing incongruous in these
subjects; properly made, they would be equally unrefined,
but <i>Helen of Troy</i>, being in the grand
manner, would be called “artistic.” Mr Griffith has
not made <i>Helen of Troy</i>, and the pre-eminent right
to make it has passed from his hands. The Keystone,
with its variations, needs still an authoritative defender
and an authoritative critic. It is one of the
few places where the genteel tradition does not operate,
where fantasy is liberated, where imagination is
still riotous and healthy. In its economy and precision
are two qualities of artistic presentation; it
uses still everything commonest and simplest and
nearest to hand; in terror of gentility, it has refrained
from using the broad farces of literature—Aristophanes
and Rabelais and Molière—as material; it
could become happily sophisticated, without being
cultured. But there is no fault inherent in its nature,
and its virtues are exceptional. For us to appreciate
slap-stick may require a revolution in our way of
looking at the arts; having taken thought on how
we now look at the arts, I suggest that the revolution
is not entirely undesirable.</p>

<p><i>The theatre of Dionysos. A great crowd is
just leaving the amphitheatre and as the attendants
roll back the heavy awnings and unleash
the tent-poles, the moon, which has been
excluded for the performance, begins to filter
in, and presently the stone begins to throw off
faint shimmers, and dark shadows fall across the
stage. The builded temple, which has been
screened, is now revealed, and its colours glow
again, albeit in shades not known to the light
of day. The porticos of temples look down upon
the theatre, and olive trees stand dark and beautiful
on the hills. From afar the bustle of the
town dies away, and, perhaps, in a moment of
unutterable stillness, the murmur of the many-sounding
sea can be heard.</i></p>

<p><i>The spectators of the strange entertainment
have at last departed, and the long e’s, ungrateful
to the ear of the Attic scholar, are
heard no more. In the far centre of the theatre a
man is taking apart a mechanism—that from
which the deus sprang in this evening’s play.
Two other men remain. One walks musing and
absorbed, looking toward that entrance whereby
Orestes was wont to make his way to the stage.
The other walks slowly round about the theatre,
marking its aspects, and thinking of practical
things. Presently they meet at the spot where
once the choragus stood. They salute each other.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr Griffith</span></p>

<p>I am sorry that you should have been here to-night.
To you, I suppose, this has been only a sacrilege.
I am sorry that you should feel that I am
gloating over my success. But perhaps I am mistaken.
Are you, or are you not, Walter Pritchard
Eaton?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr Eaton</span></p>

<p>I am. And you are David Wark Griffith, are
you not? [<i>D. G. nods.</i>] We are well met, then—if
I may make use of a phrase which the drama, and
not your <i>métier</i> has made famous. By the way,
ought I to “register” pleasure in any conventional
way?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Score one for you. I have sinned. But since you
say we are well met, can’t we chat for a moment about
things? You see, I am not altogether unaffected by
this scene—the light, and the ancient theatre, and
the memories of it all.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>They would all do admirably for a picture—for
one of those extraordinary scenic effects which you
create as no other man can create them. But the
memories—those at least are mine. Surely you are
not thinking <span class="locked">of—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>No. Not just now. I am humble at times. But
let us say that you are the great antagonist
of the movies, and I the protagonist. I want very
much to understand what you mean when you attack
them. I remember you said that my spectacle, <i>The
Birth of a Nation</i>, was violently unfair because it
was wordless. Am I not right?</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>I said some such thing.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>And you are a defender of the theatre. May I
assume that <i>The Clansman</i>, which was a spoken
drama, was more fair than my spectacle?</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>At least, in the play, there was a reply in
kind to every attack. The dumb-show for which
you are responsible showed only one side.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Then you are attacking the movie for being
a propaganda, and are displeased with the propaganda
because it is one-sided. May I say that possibly
the movie was made as an artistic spectacle,
and had no such object? And do I not recall the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
surprise with which such a play as <i>Strife</i> was received
because it did show two sides? After all, I did not
make it impossible for you to put on <i>Uncle Tom’s
Cabin</i> as a reply to me.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>It would be fruitless to continue the discussion
on this point. I spoke of your movie in passing,
because I am always hearing about it. For the most
part let us admit that it was not cheap. Can you
say as much for the others?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>No. The movie is a vulgar art—it is <i>the</i>
vulgar art. And certainly I do not purpose to rob
that statement of its effectiveness by saying that the
word must be taken in its best, or even in its original,
meaning. It must be taken in its worst meaning.
The movie is vulgar, but it is art. The best of it
is none too good—yet. But the worst of it is not so
bad as you think.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>I am willing to grant you that in the representation
of spectacle, in the realm of trick photography
and in the preservation of the events of the moment,
the movie has its place. I question it only when it
invades the drama. There you must pardon me. I
have the drama close to my heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>You have been warming the viper quite a
long time. It is about to sting. I am willing to
grant you that in musical comedy, in purely intellectual
engagements, and in the exploitation of sound,
the drama has its place. But I have noticed in your
own complaints that in the things that touch the
heart, in the grand manner, in the projection of high
emotion, you find the drama of to-day a pretty sad
affair.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Who is to blame for it?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Who killed Cock Robin? Not I. I had
not heard that the Comédie-Française was seriously
affected by the activities of Pathé Frères. I have yet
to learn that music has been driven into hiding by
the movies, although I have heard that the ride of the
Valkyries is more familiarly known to-day as the
“Klan-theme” from <i>The Birth</i>. Didn’t your theatre
die—if it has died—because it stifled itself? Hadn’t
you noticed the decline ten years ago?</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>I am not blaming the movie. I am deploring
it. I do not think that it is good for people to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
be eternally fed on whatever is cheapest, nearest,
easiest of comprehension. I object to it all the more
when something high and fine is butchered to make
a movie holiday.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>I deplore that as much as you. I do not think
that <i>Cabiria</i> was cheap, or easy of comprehension.
There was enough on the surface to make it popular.
But there was also enough in the depths to make
it grand.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>The movie is still two-dimensional, Mr Griffith.
Can we speak of depths?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Ah, you say “still”! Then we have a future.
In the theatre there was a long succession of little
known men, and then came the men whose plays
made these stones sacred to you. There were many
Elizabethans before Shakespeare. Will you call me
the Marlowe of the movies? I believe in them
enough to hope for a Shakespeare. But don’t you
see that we are young; we are without <span class="locked">conventions—</span></p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Pardon me. You are with far too many. I remember
that in the early days, when you went about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
on tiptoe for fear of waking up the revengeful
Muses, you employed actors without any technique.
There was an uncouth, a delightful freshness, about
your work. I had hopes then that you would contribute
to the stage. Instead you have taken from it.
You have borrowed all its worst conventions. And
you have added some of your own. There is the
dreadful convention of registering.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Isn’t that from the stage?</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Hardly.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Your actors and actresses register.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Not as yours do. The long training in the expression
of emotions has developed a suitable
medium, the slightest variation on which becomes
inestimably precious. In the moving picture the
variation is unknown. And, although I am the last
person to want to advantage the movie, let me tell
you why. I can hear the voice of the director, just
as the misguided husband leaves his wife—a favorite
situation in the movies and very novel—I can hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
him crying out, “Register grief!” If he does not
cry out, the inner voice of the actress cries out. Not
“feel,” not “express the feeling,” but express the
semblance of grief. It is an art of superficies. Perhaps
your actresses—and why, dear sir, do you choose
such impossibly blond, pretty and stupid actresses?—have
worked out a new expression, a new registration.
At the terrible moment they forget. They
register as they, or another actress as well paid and
as hotly advertised, registered six months before. I
am as tired of heaving breasts and eyes turned to
heaven as I am tired of Charlie Chaplin’s walk when
he does not walk it. Conventions? There is no
end to them. What your art, as you call it, lacks, is
limitations.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>You mean there are no limits to it? That is a
strange remark for you to make.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>No. I do not mean that. I mean that every
art, until recent times, has proposed certain limitations,
under which it had to work. Goethe—a poet
whom you have yet to introduce to your spectators—once
wrote, “<i>In der Beschränkung zeigt sich erst der
Meister!</i>” And these limitations must be more
than physical. There is no reason why a poem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
should rhyme abbaabbacdcdcd, but the sonnet must
rhyme in some such manner, or it will not be perfect.
There may be greater poems than these sonnets—that
is a matter of taste—but the art of the sonnet has
its own perfection because those limitations have been
accepted joyously by those who chose to write. You
have proposed no limitations to yourself. Your art
is chaos.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Didn’t I confess as much when I said it was vulgar?
It must have its appeal to the very lowest.
But because our roots are in the dung and the mire,
do you think there shall be no lovely blossoms on
the trees in spring and no fruit? If I make a fortune
in raw melodrama, shall I not spend it on Helen of
Troy?</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Helen of Troy?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Why not? The moving picture is always elemental,
but it can be grand. What are the essentials
of a story: love, beauty, pursuit, coincidence, <span class="locked">rescue—</span></p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Tell me, Mr Griffith, is it true that you recite
“The Relief at Lucknow” each night before you go
to bed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Not now. I am reciting the Iliad now. Can’t
you see the battlements of Troy with Helen looking
down from her tower—the ruinous <span class="locked">face—</span></p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Registering?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Again a hit! But I shall overcome it. I shall
show you Scamander rising from his bed, and the
gods on high <span class="locked">Olympus—</span></p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>With a close-up of the beard of Zeus?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>And Patroclus leaping on the Ilian shore, and
Achilles sulking in his tent. I shall make Homer live
again.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Dear me. Is he dead? Why wasn’t I informed?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>Love and battle, heroism and beauty, action and
emotion, pity and terror—what more can you ask?
All the great sum of Hellenic life, its morning glow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
and its great noon of enviable beauty, shall be in my
picture. It shall mingle humanity with the gods
again.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Through the exquisite agency of cutbacks?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>As surely as Marlowe’s topless towers—the captions
are written for me—rose in the backdrops of
your theatres. I shall glorify the mechanics of my
art. I shall make them invisible and divine. I shall
speak in words of white <span class="locked">fire—</span></p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Perhaps. But you will never speak with the
tongues of angels—and of men. I will admit the
dulness of the theatre if you will grant the absurdity
of the mechanics you employ. I will ask you only if
the moving picture will ever become human?</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p>I do not know. I am not sure that humanity
is very translatable. But we have ecstasy. In the
projector lies all wonderful adventure, and I go
into a dingy, stuffy, moving-picture house with
the foreknowledge that something strange and wonderful,
though it be at times cheap and vulgar, will
be shown me. In a drab world the movie is an instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
of miracles. The gross caricatures are perhaps
truer than the realism of the theatre. I see a
Rabelaisian madness in the millions of broken plates.
In a thousand flying custard pies I recognize an
eternal impulse of humankind. In the mad comings
and goings of impossible characters I still see some
persuasion that life is “wanton and wondrous and
forever well.” Here, in this theatre, life was once
glorified. But the grandeur has died out and we must
restore it as we can.</p>

<p class="speaker">W. P. E.</p>

<p>Not in my time, I fear. For me the past is not
dead, so you cannot restore it. And here, in the end,
you have my last objection to the moving picture.
You are destroying the imagination of mankind.
There are no more mysteries since your work has
come into being. Everything is visible. Everything
is explained.</p>

<p class="speaker">D. G.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">For</span> most of us the grotesque effigy dangling from
the electric sign or propped against the side of the
ticket-booth must remain our first memory of Charlie
Chaplin. The splay feet, the moustache, the derby
hat, the rattan walking-stick, composed at once the
image which was ten years later to become the universal
symbol of laughter. “<i>I am here to-day</i>” was
his legend, and like everything else associated with
his name it is faintly ironic and exactly right. The
man who, of all the men of our time, seems most
assured of immortality, chose that particularly transient
announcement of his presence, “I am here to-day,”
with its emotional overtone of “gone to-morrow,”
and there is always something in Charlie that
slips away. “He does things,” said John S. Sargent
once, “and you’re lucky if you see them.” Incredibly
lucky to live when we have the chance to see
them.</p>

<p>It is a miracle that there should arise in our time
a figure wholly in the tradition of the great clowns—a
tradition requiring creative energy, freshness, inventiveness,
change—for neither the time nor the
country in which Charlie works is exceptionally
favourable to such a phenomenon. Stranger still is
the course he has run. It is simple to take <i>The Kid</i>
as the dividing line, but it is more to the point to
consider the phases of Charlie’s popularity, for each
phase corresponds to one of the attacks now being
made upon his integrity. He is on the top of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
world, an exposed position, and we are all sniping
at him; even his adherents are inclined to say that
“after all” he is “still” this or the other thing. One
goes to his pictures as one went to hear Caruso, with
a ghoulish speculation as to the quantity of alloy in
the “golden voice.” It is because Charlie has had all
there ever was of acclaim that he is now surrounded
by deserters.</p>

<p>That he exists at all is due to the camera and
to the selective genius of Mack Sennett. It is impossible
to dissociate him entirely from the Keystone
comedy where he began and worked wonders and
learned much. The injustice of forgetting Sennett
and the Keystone when thinking of Chaplin has undermined
most of the intellectual appreciation of
his work, for although he was the greatest of the
Keystone comedians and passed far beyond them, the
first <i>and decisive</i> phase of his popularity came while
he was with them, and the Keystone touch remains
in all his later work, often as its most precious element.
It was the time of Charlie’s actual contact
with the American people, the movie-going populace
before the days of the great moving pictures. He
was the second man to be known widely by name—John
Bunny was the first—and he achieved a fame
which passed entirely by word of mouth into the
category of the common myths and legends of
America, as the name of Buffalo Bill had passed before.
By the time the newspapers recognized the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
movie as a source of circulation, Charlie was already
a known quantity in the composition of the American
mind and, what is equally significant, he had
created the first <i>Charlot</i>. The French name which
is and is not Charlie will serve for that figure on the
screen, the created image which is, and at the same
time is more than, Charlie Chaplin, and is less. Like
every great artist in whatever medium, Charlie has
created the mask of himself—many masks, in fact—and
the first of these, the wanderer, came in the
Keystone comedies. It was there that he first detached
himself from life and began to live in another
world, with a specific rhythm of his own, as if
the pulse-beat in him changed and was twice or half
as fast as that of those who surrounded him. He
created then that trajectory across the screen which
is absolutely his own line of movement. No matter
what the actual facts are, the curve he plots is always
the same. It is of one who seems to enter from
a corner of the screen, becomes entangled or involved
in a force greater than himself as he advances upward
and to the centre; there he spins like a marionette
in a whirlpool, is flung from side to side,
always in a parabola which seems centripetal until
the madness of the action hurls him to refuge or compels
him to flight at the opposite end of the screen.
He wanders in, a stranger, an impostor, an anarchist;
and passes again, buffeted, but unchanged.</p>

<p>The Keystone was the time of his wildest grotesquerie<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
(after <i>Tillie’s Punctured Romance</i>, to be
sure), as if he needed, for a beginning, sharply to
contrast his rhythm, his gait, his gesture, <i>mode</i>, with
the actual world outside. His successes in this period
were confined to those films in which the world intruded
with all its natural crassness upon his detached
existence. There was a film in which Charlie
dreamed himself back into the Stone Age and played
the God of the Waters—wholly without success because
he contrasted his fantasy with another fantasy
in the same tempo, and could neither sink into nor
stand apart from it. But in <i>His Night Out</i> the effect
is perfect, and is intensified by the alternating coincidence
and syncopation of rhythm in which Ben
Turpin worked with him. Charlie’s drunken line
of march down a stairway was first followed in
parallel and then in not-quite-parallel by Turpin;
the degree of drunkenness was the same, then varied,
then returned to identity; and the two, together, were
always entirely apart from the actuality of bars and
hotels and fountains and policemen which were properties
in their existence. In this early day Charlie
had already mastered his principles. He knew that
the broad lines are funny and that the fragments—which
are delicious—must “point” the main line of
laughter. I recall, for example, an exquisite moment
at the end of this film. Turpin is staggering down
the street, dragging Charlie by the collar. Essentially
the funny thing is that one drunkard should so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
gravely, so soberly, so obstinately take care of another
and should convert himself into a policeman
to do it; it is funny that they should be going nowhere,
and go so doggedly. The lurching-forward
body of Turpin, the singular angle formed with it
by Charlie’s body almost flat on the ground, added to
the spectacle. And once as they went along Charlie’s
right hand fell to one side, and as idly as a girl
plucks a water-lily from over the side of a canoe he
plucked a daisy from the grass border of the path,
and smelled it. The function of that gesture was
to make everything that went before, and everything
that came after, seem funnier; and it succeeded by
creating another, incongruous image out of the picture
before our eyes. The entire world, a moment earlier,
had been aslant and distorted and wholly male; it
righted itself suddenly and created a soft idyll of
tenderness. Nearly everything of Charlie is in that
moment, and I know no better way to express its
elusive quality than to say that as I sat watching
the film a second time, about two hours later, the
repetition of the gesture came with all the effect of
surprise, although I had been wondering whether he
could do it so perfectly again.</p>

<p>This was the Charlie whom little children came
to know before any other and whose name they added
to their prayers. He was then popular with the people;
he was soon to become universally known and
admired—the Charlie of <i>The Bank</i> and of <i>Shoulder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Arms</i>; and finally he became “the great artist” in
<i>The Kid</i>. The second period is pure development;
the third is change; and the adherents of each join
with the earlier enthusiasts to instruct and alarm
their idol. No doubt the middle phase is the one
which is richest in memory. It includes the masterpieces
<i>A Dog’s Life</i>, <i>The Pawnshop</i>, <i>The Vagabond</i>,
<i>Easy Street</i>, as well as the two I have just mentioned,
and, if I am not mistaken, the <i>genre</i> pictures like
<i>The Floorwalker</i>, <i>The Fireman</i>, <i>The Immigrant</i>, and
the fantastic <i>Cure</i>. To name these pictures is to call
to mind their special scenes, the atmosphere in which
they were played: the mock heroic of <i>The Bank</i> and
its parody of passion; the unbelievable scene behind
the curtain in <i>A Dog’s Life</i>; Charlie as policeman in
<i>Easy Street</i>, which had some of the beginnings of
<i>The Kid</i>; Charlie left marking time alone after the
squad had marched away in the film which made camp
life supportable. Compare them with the very earliest
films, <i>The Pile Driver</i> and the wheel-chairman
film and so on: the later ones are richer in inventiveness,
the texture is more solid, the emotions grow
more complex, and the interweaving of tenderness
and gravity with the fun becomes infinitely more
deft. In essence it is the same figure—he is still a
vagrant, an outsider; only now when he becomes
entangled in the lives of other people he is a bit of
a crusader, too. The accidental does not occur so
frequently; the progress of each film is plotted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
advance; there is a definite rise and fall as in <i>A Dog’s
Life</i>, where the climax is in the curtain scene toward
which tends the first episode of the dog and from
which the flight and the rustic idyll flow gently downward.
The pace in the earlier pictures was more
instinctive. In <i>The Count</i> the tempo is jerky; it
moves from extreme to extreme. Yet one gets the
sense of the impending flight beautifully when, at
the close, Charlot as the bogus count has been shown
up and is fleeing pell-mell through every room in
the house; the whole movement grows tense; the rate
of acceleration perceptibly heightens as Charlot slides
in front of a vast birthday cake, pivots on his heel,
and begins to play alternate pool and golf with the
frosting, making every shot count like a machine
gunner barricaded in a pill-box or a bandit in a deserted
cabin.</p>

<p>It was foreordained that the improvised kind of
comedy should give way to something more calculated,
and in Charlie’s case it is particularly futile to
cry over spilled milk because for a long time he continued
to give the <i>effect</i> of impromptu; his sudden
movements and his finds in the way of unsuspected
sources of fun are exceptional to this day. In <i>The
Pawnshop</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Charlie begins to sweep and catches in
his broom the end of a long rope, which, instead of
being swept away, keeps getting longer, actively
fighting the broom. I have no way to prove it, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
I am sure from the context that this is all he had
originally had in mind to do with the scene. Suddenly
the tape on the floor creates something in his
mind, and Charlie transforms the back room of the
pawnshop into a circus, with himself walking the
tight rope—a graceful, nimble balancing along the
thin line of tape on the floor, the quick turn and coming
forward, the conventional bow, arms flung out,
smiling, to receive applause at the end. Again, as
ever, he has created an imaginary scene out of the
materials of the actual.</p>

<p>The plotting of these comedies did not destroy
Charlie’s inventiveness and made it possible for him
to develop certain other of his characteristics. The
moment the vagrant came to rest, the natural man appeared,
the paradoxical creature who has the wisdom
of simple souls and the incalculable strength of the
weak. Charlie all through the middle period is at
least half Tyl Eulenspiegl. It is another way for
him to live apart from the world by assuming that
the world actually means what it says, by taking
every one of its conventional formulas, its polite
phrases and idioms, with dreadful seriousness. He
has created in Charlot a radical with an extraordinarily
logical mind. Witness Charlot arriving late
at the theatre and stepping on the toes of a whole row
of people to his seat at the far end; the gravity of
his expressions of regret is only matched by his humiliation
when he discovers that he is, after all, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
wrong row and makes his way back again and all
through the next row to his proper place. It is a
careful exaggeration of the social fiction that when
you apologise you can do anything to anyone. The
same feeling underlies the characteristic moment
when Charlot is fighting and suddenly stops, takes
off his hat and coat, gives them to his opponent to
hold, and then promptly knocks his obliging adversary
down. Revisiting once an old Charlie, I saw him
do this, and a few minutes later saw the same thing
in a new Harold Lloyd; all there is to know of the
difference between the two men was to be learned
there; for Lloyd, who is a clever fellow, made it seem
a smart trick so to catch his enemy off guard, while
Chaplin made the moment equal to the conventional
crossing of swords or the handshake before a prize
fight. Similarly, the salutation with the hat takes
seriously a social convention and carries it as far
as it can go. In <i>Pay Day</i> Charlot arrives late to
work and attempts to mollify the furious construction-gang
boss by handing him an Easter lily.</p>

<p><i>The Kid</i> was undoubtedly a beginning in “literature”
for Charlie. I realize that in admitting this I
am giving the whole case away, for in the opinion
of certain critics the beginning of literature is the
end of creative art. This attitude is not so familiar
in America, but in France you hear the Charlot of
<i>The Kid</i> spoken of as “theatre,” as one who has
ceased to be of the film entirely. I doubt if this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
is just. Like the one other great artist in America
(George Herriman, with whom he is eminently in
sympathy), Charlie has always had the Dickens touch,
a thing which in its purity we do not otherwise discover
in our art. Dickens himself is mixed; only a
part of him is literature, and that not the best, nor
is that part essentially the one which Charlie has imported
to the screen. <i>The Kid</i> had some bad things
in it: the story, the halo round the head of the unmarried
mother, the quarrel with the authorities; it
had an unnecessary amount of realism and its tempo
was uncertain, for it was neither serious film nor
Keystone. Yet it possessed moments of unbelievable
intensity and touches of high imagination. The
scenes in and outside the doss-house were excellent
and were old Charlie; the glazier’s assistant was inventive
and the training of Coogan to look like his
foster-father was beautiful. Far above them stood
the beginning of the film: Charlot, in his usual polite
rags, strolling down to his club after his breakfast
(it would have been a grilled bone) and, avoiding
slops as Villon did, twirling his cane, taking off his
fingerless gloves to reach for his cigarette case (a
sardine box), and selecting from the butts one of
quality, <i>tamping it</i> to shake down the excess tobacco
at the tip—all of this, as Mr Herriman pointed out
to me, was the creation of the society gentleman, the
courageous refusal to be undermined by slums and
poverty and rags. At the end of the film there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
the vision of heaven: apotheosis of the long suffering
of Charlot at the hands of the police, not only in
<i>The Kid</i>—in a hundred films where he stood always
against the authorities, always for his small independent
freedom. The world in which even policemen
have wings shatters, too; but something remains.
The invincible Charlot, dazed by his dream, looking
for wings on the actual policeman who is apparently
taking him to jail, will not down. For as they start,
a post comes between them, and Charlot, without the
slightest effort to break away, too submissive to fight,
still dodges back to walk round the post and so avoid
bad luck. A moment later comes one of the highest
points in Charlie’s career. He is ushered into a
limousine instead of a patrol wagon—it is the beginning
of the happy ending. And as the motor starts
he flashes at the spectators of his felicity a look of
indescribable poignancy. It is frightened, it is hopeful,
bewildered; it lasts a fraction of a second and is
blurred by the plate glass of the car. I cannot hope
to set down the quality of it, how it becomes a moment
of unbearable intensity, and how one is breathless
with suspense—and with adoration.</p>

<p>For, make no mistake, it is adoration, not less,
that he deserves and has from us. He corresponds to
our secret desires because he alone has passed beyond
our categories, at one bound placing himself outside
space and time. His escape from the world is complete
and extraordinarily rapid, and what makes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
him more than a figure of romance is his immediate
creation of another world. He has the vital energy,
the composing and the functioning brain. This is
what makes him æsthetically interesting, what will
make him for ever a school not only of acting, but of
the whole creative process. The flow of his line always
corresponds to the character and tempo; there is
a definite relation between the melody and the orchestration
he gives it. Beyond his technique—the
style of his pieces—he has composition, because he
creates anything but chaos in his separate world.
“You might,” wrote Mr Stark Young, wise in everything
but the choice of the person addressed, “you
might really create in terms of the moving picture as
you have already created in terms of character.” As
I have said, the surest way to be wrong about Charlie
is to forget the Keystone.</p>

<p>This is precisely what Mr Stark Young would
like him to do—and what Charlie may do if the intellectual
nonsense about him is capable of corrupting
his natural wisdom and his creative gift. Mr Young
has addressed an open letter to “Dear Mr Chaplin”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
in which he suggests that Charlie play <i>Liliom</i> and
<i>He Who Gets Slapped</i> and <i>Peer Gynt</i>. (Offended
as I am by these ideas, I must be fair. Mr Young
does say that better than all of these, “you could
do new things written by or for you, things in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
you would use your full endowment, comic and otherwise
... develop things calculated strictly for it
[the screen] and for no other art, made up out of its
essential quality, which is visual motion and not mere
stage drama photographed....”) This is, of course,
corruption. It means that Mr Young has either not
seen the Charlie of before <i>The Kid</i> (as I suspect from
the phrase about creating in terms of character) or not
liked him (which I am sure about); he has failed
to recognize in <i>The Pawnbroker</i> “his full endowment,
comic and otherwise.” It implies to me that
Mr Young would prefer a “serious film” and that
suggests the complete absence of a critical sense, of
taste and gusto, of wisdom and gaiety, of piety and
wit. “The larger field” ... “serious efforts” ...
“a more cultured audience” ... “the judicious”—O
Lord! these are the phrases which are offered as
bribes to the one man who has destroyed the world
and created it in his own image!</p>

<p>There is a future for him as for others, and it is
quite possible that the future may not be as rich and
as dear as the past. I write this without having
seen <i>The Pilgrim</i>, which ought to be a test case,
for the two films which followed <i>The Kid</i> (<i>Pay Day</i>
and <i>The Idle Class</i>) determined nothing. If the
literary side conquers we shall have a great character
actor and not a creator; we shall certainly not
have again the image of riot and fun, the created
personage, the annihilation of actuality; we may go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
so far as to accomplish Mr Stark Young’s ideal and
have a serious work of art. I hope this will not happen,
because I do not believe that it is the necessary
curve of Charlie’s genius—it is the direction of
worldly success, not in money, but in fame; it is
not the curve of life at all. For the slowing-up of
Charlie’s physical energies and the deepening of his
understanding may well restore to him his appreciation
of those early monuments to laughter which are
his greatest achievement. He stood then shod in
absurdity, but with his feet on the earth. And he
danced on the earth, an eternal figure of lightness
and of the wisdom which knows that the earth was
made to dance on. It was a green earth, excited with
its own abundance and fruitfulness, and he possessed
it entirely. For me he remains established in possession.
As it spins under his feet he dances silently
and with infinite grace upon it. It is as if in his
whole life he had spoken only one word: “I am here
<i>to-day</i>”—the beginning before time and the end
without end of his wisdom and of his loveliness.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> popular song is never forgotten—except in
public. Great events and seven-day-wonders pass
into oblivion. Hobson, who was a hero, became a
prohibitionist; Aguinaldo, a good citizen; McKinley,
a martyr—but <i>Good-by, Dolly Gray</i>, <i>In the Good
Old Summer Time</i>, and <i>Just Break the News to
Mother</i> are immortal in our private memories and
around them crystallize the sights and sounds and
smells, the very quality of the air we breathed when
these songs were in their high day. A more judicious
pen than mine may write about these songs without
sentimentality; I cannot. For in addition to the
pathos of time past, something else brings an air of
gentle melancholy to “words and music.” In recent
years a change has come and the popular song is no
longer written to be sung, but to be played. The
new song that can’t be sung has virtues of its own—on
the whole they are virtues I prefer. But I doubt
whether it will ever be, as the old song was, a clue
to the social history of our time.</p>

<p>The popular song is so varied, so full of interest,
that for a moment at least one can pretend that it
isn’t vulgar, detestable, the ruin of musical taste, and
a symptom of degeneracy; we can pretend also that
<i>Less Than the Dust</i> isn’t more artistic than <i>Swanee</i>.
Since the Spanish-American War the American popular
song (including the foreign song popular in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
America) has undergone the most interesting modulations;
it has expressed everything except <i>fin de
siècle</i>. Out of the ’nineties persisted a characteristic
song: <i>Ta-ra-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i>, the chorus and tune of
which, woven into mysterious words about “three
little niggers in a peanut shell” I must have heard
at the same time as <i>Daisy</i> with its glorification of the
simple life “on a bicycle built for two.” Since then,
for a rough generalization, we have had three types
of popular song: the exotic-romantic, the sentimental,
and the raggy-gay. The sentimental song we have
always with us. “That sweet melody with a strong
mother appeal” is advertised on the back of “Those
Black Boy Blues” and Irving Berlin writes <i>When I
Lost You</i> between <i>Alexander’s Ragtime Band</i> and
<i>Some Sunny Day</i>. At moments it is dominant and
a fake ballad, with a simple and uninteresting tune,
makes <i>After the Ball</i>, by Charles K. Harris, a world
wonder. Or we have a simplification of the whole
history of romantic love in <i>Love Me and the World
Is Mine</i>. The curious about social life in America
may compare this song with <i>I’m Just Wild About
Harry</i>.</p>

<p>Beaumarchais, who knew no jazz, makes Figaro
say that what can’t be said can be sung—and this
applies far more to the sentimental than to the obscene.
Think of the incredible, the almost unspeakable
idea in the following, presumably spoken by a
father to a child:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">You’ll find your mamma there!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Or consider the pretty imagery and emotion of <i>I’m
Tying the Leaves</i>, as sung by a precocious and abominable
child who has been told that mother will die
when the leaves begin to fall. It would be easy to
say that these songs are gone never to return; but
it was only two years ago that <i>They Needed a Songbird
in Heaven—so God Took Caruso Away</i> (“idea
suggested by George Walter Brown” to the grateful
composers). I do not dare to contemplate <i>A Baby’s
Prayer at Twilight</i> or to wonder what constituted
the <i>Curse of an Aching Heart</i>; but history has left
on record the chorus of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My Mother was a Lady</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like yours, you will allow,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">It was for songs like this that a masterpiece in another
<i>genre</i>, the burlesque popular song, was created.
I have heard <i>A Working Girl Was Leaving Home</i>
credited to the brothers Smith (the boys the mother-in-law
joke invented, according to George Jean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Nathan, and for their sins they should have written
this song) and to the late Tiny Maxwell, and to an
unidentified English source. It’s title and chorus at
least are immortal:</p>

<p>(Then to him these proud words this girl did say):</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">But Heaven Will Protect the Working Girl.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cure for the sentimental song is the ironic;
and irony, it happens, is not what America lives on.
Even so mild an English example as <i>Waiting at the
Church</i> gained its popularity chiefly from the excellent
tag line:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Can’t get away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To marry you to-day.</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Yet appearing from time to time we had a sort of
frank destruction of sentimentality in our songs.
Some, like <i>I Picked up a Lemon in the Garden of
Love</i>, appeal directly to the old “peaches” tradition;
but we went further. In the same year as the romantic
<i>Beautiful Garden of Roses</i>—it was one of the
early years of the dance craze—we heard <i>Who Are
You With To-night</i> (to-night?...) down to “Will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
you tell your wife in the morning, Who you are with
to-night?” and the music perceptibly winked at the
words. <i>I Love My Wife (but, Oh, You Kid!)</i> had
little quality, but the dramatization of an old joke
in <i>My Wife’s Gone to the Country</i> rose to a definite
gaiety in the cry of “Hooray! Hooray!” So, too,
one line in the chorus of <i>I Wonder Who’s Kissing
Her Now</i>, a song which skilfully builds up a sentimental
situation in order to tear it down with two
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Wonder who’s looking into her eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Breathing sighs, telling lies ...</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">where the music pretended to make no difference between
the last two phrases, except for softening,
sweetening the second. Yet another in the malicious
mould is <i>Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van
Winkle (when Rip Van Winkle Went Away)</i>—unforgettable
for the tearing upward phrase to a climax
in the first <i>Rip</i> with a parallel high note on the
second.</p>

<p>The characteristic of these songs is that they were
rather like contemporary fiction in giving form to
social phenomena without expressing approval or disapproval.
Eternal love and fidelity go by the board
with “the dreamy, peachy, creamy, Vision of pure delight,”
the companion who will not be mentioned to
“your wife in the morning.” “Tell me, Mister, Is
it your sister....” Well, hardly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>There were, beside these realistic treatments of
marriage (I continue the professorial tone) a few
slightly suggestive songs, and these also were opposed
to current morality, and these also were popular.
One was called, I think, <i>Billy</i>, and purported to be
a statement of virginal devotion: “And when I walk,
I always walk with Billy ...” and so following, to
“And when I sleep, I always—dream of Bill.” There
were delicious implications in <i>Row, Row, Row</i>, as
Al Jolson sang it; earlier still was Hattie Williams’s
song <i>Experience</i>, in <i>The Little Cherub</i>. The persistence
of these songs is something of a miracle and
the shade of difference between the permissible and
the impossible is of vast importance in the success of
a song. About fifteen years separate <i>Who Are You
With To-Night?</i> (I quote all these songs and titles
from memory, but I am fairly sure about the grammar
of this one; if it was printed “whom” it was sung
“who”) and <i>He May be Your Man (but he comes
to see me sometimes)</i>, and the second song is more
explicit; when Edith Wilson or Florence Mills sang
the repeat chorus it shocked her audience. Essentially
it is the same thing, only, fifteen years ago,
the questionable stanza would have been left to the
unauthorized street version.</p>

<p>The exotic romantic song in America has little
to do with all of this. Before the professional glorification
of our separate states began, we had the series
of Indian songs of which Neil Moret’s <i>Hiawatha</i> is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
the outstanding exemplar. The stanza is almost as
hard to sing as <i>The Star-spangled Banner</i>; the chorus—it
is always the chorus which makes a song—is
banal, a pure rum-tum-tiddy. Yet it was more than
popular, for it engendered a hundred others. <i>Cheyenne</i>
and (musically) <i>Rainbow</i> are its descendants. <i>Hiawatha</i>
bewilders and baffles the searcher after causes;
but its badness as a song explains why the Indian
song was submerged presently in the great wave of
negro songs which have shown an amazing vitality,
have outlived the Hawaiian exotic, and with marvelous
adaptability (aided by one great natural advantage)
have lived through to the present day.</p>

<p>The negro song is partly, but not purely, exotic.
Remembering that songs are written on Forty-fifth
Street in New York and put over in New York
cabarets, it is easy to see how <i>California in September</i>
(a dreadful song) and <i>Carolina</i> (I recall five songs
embodying the name of that state; the latest is superb)
are also exotic; and how <i>Over on the Jersey
Side</i> and songs about Coney Island came to be written
to glorify New York as a summer resort. The rustic
period, again, reacts against sophistication as <i>In the
Shade of the Old Apple Tree</i> reacts against the
exoticism of the sheltering palm. Neither rustic nor
local, however, achieves the highest success, and it is
left for the Pacific to give the last setting before the
shouting song of the negro and his plaintive cry are
triumphant in our music.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>

<p>First, however, the era of the waltz song. In
earlier days America had little to do with the waltz
out of comic opera and <i>The Merry Widow</i> and <i>My
Hero</i> and <i>Beautiful Lady</i> and the superb melodies
from <i>Gypsy Love</i> and from <i>Die Czardas Fürstin</i>, of
which I forget the American name, and something
from <i>The Arcadians</i> came from anywhere across the
sea and captured us. The <i>Velia Song</i> and <i>The Girl
from the Saskatchewan</i> were better than their corresponding
waltzes; <i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> had pages
of music as good as <i>My Hero</i>—many better. Only
<i>The Dollar Princess</i> managed to put over its less
ostentatious pieces—and that is rather amusing, since
Leo Fall is held by the Viennese to be the true
successor of Johann Strauss.</p>

<p>The mention of that great name makes it clear
that the waltz song itself is a hybrid; for whatever
words have been sung to <i>The Beautiful Blue Danube</i>,
the music was meant to be played and for the dance;
it was not meant for song. Yet the slow tempo,
the softness, the gentle sentimentality of the waltz
lends itself peculiarly to song—and to memory. I
do not think it has anything to do with the really
great things in our popular songs, but I cannot resent
its success—any more than I can resent the
success of another song, wholly out of our American
line—<i>Un Peu d’Amour</i>. This was the last great
song before the war; it held France and England
and America enslaved to its amorous longing. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
more cheery and more male had to be found for
the English soldier, who eventually picked up <i>Tipperary</i>
(also a song of nostalgia), and for the American
something snappier; but <i>Un Peu d’Amour</i> persisted
during the war. To hear a soldier standing
on the fire-step on a dark night, leaning his cheek
against the disc of his Lewis gun, and softly humming
<i>Un Peu d’Amour</i>, was to recognize that for
actual millions that song and a few others like it,
and not the great music to the condition of which all
art aspires, were all of beauty and all of exaltation
they were ever to know. The materials in this particular
case were not tawdry, only equivocal. For
it was a better song as <i>A Little Love</i> than in the
French. The word <i>amour</i> means, but does not signify,
the same thing as the word love, and “<i>pour
t’entendre à ce moment suprême, Murmurer tout bas,
tout bas: Je t’aime</i>” has connotations not transferred
to the English. The song is a fake French and a
good Anglo-Saxon piece of sentiment, precisely the
counterpart of the waltz song. Like them it conquered
a world.</p>

<p>Lehar and Monckton and Caryll and Fall and
Kalman followed successes with moderate failure,
and at the same time revues and American musical
comedies stepped out grandly. I note three songs
from this source which actually claimed all of the
popular attention. The song to be sung was at its
best in the Princess shows—best of all in <i>The Siren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
Song</i> from <i>Leave it to Jane</i>. It is Mr Kern’s masterpiece,
a sophisticated, tidy score with amusing and unexpected
retards and pauses, with a fresh freedom of
tonalities. <i>The Siren Song</i> never actually came up to
<i>The Love Nest</i> in acclaim; Mr Hirsch’s bid for
immortality is almost contemptible in words and
music and has only a single point of interest—the
three notes against two in the second line of the
chorus (“cozyandwarm” instead of, say, nice—and—warm).
It is impermissible in a man who only a
year later wrote <i>It’s Getting Very Dark on Old
Broadway</i>.</p>

<p>The third song is <i>Say It With Music</i>. Mr
Berlin is as much responsible as any one for the
turn from the song-to-be-sung to the song-to-be-played;
yet he is so remarkable that he can reverse
himself, and just as in 1915 he produced a whole
revue (<i>Stop! Look! Listen!</i>) from which not one
song became really popular, so, seven years later,
when the singing-song had gone out, he produced a
revue and gave us one more of his tributes to the art
he adores. It isn’t musically half as interesting as
<i>I Love a Piano</i>; but it is much more singable and it
has great virtues. Nothing that a jazz orchestra can
do has any effect on the purity of its musical line. I
wonder whether it may not be the last of the songs;
for we are now full in the jazz age and darkness
has set in.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="TEARING_A_PASSION_TO_RAGTIME">TEARING A PASSION TO RAGTIME</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">There</span> is only one sense in which the word “rag”
has any meaning in connexion with music, and that
is not conveyed in the word “ragtime.” Ragtime is
not, strictly speaking, time at all; neither is <i>tempo
rubato</i>: and eminently safe composers have been
known to score their music <i>con alcuna licenza</i>, which
leaves the delicate adjustment of time to the performer.
A certain number of liberties may be taken
with ragtime, and beyond this point no liberties may
be taken. Within its framework, ragtime is definite
enough; and you must syncopate at precisely the
right, the indicated and required moment, or the
effect of the syncopation is lost.</p>

<p>It is only when one looks at the songs that one
realizes what ragtime means. For literally, the
music, which has always been with us and yet arrived
only yesterday, has torn to rags the sentimentality
of the song which preceded it. The funeral oration
for the popular song was preached in the preceding
chapter. This is the coroner’s inquest, with the probable
verdict that the popular song was unintentionally
killed by ragtime, which is in turn being slowly
poisoned by jazz. A neat, unobtrusive, little man
with bright eyes and an unerring capacity for understanding,
appropriating, and creating strange
rhythms is in the foreground, attended by negro
slaves; behind him stands a rather majestic figure,
pink and smooth, surrounded by devils with muted
brass and saxophones. They are Irving Berlin and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
Paul Whiteman, and they will bear listening to.
What is more, they will make listening a pleasure.</p>

<p>It seems strange to speak of the great George M.
Cohan as a disappointment in anything he has ever
tried; but looking back at the early years of the century,
when it was apparent that he would be our
most popular song writer as well as our most popular
everything else, suddenly calls to mind that our
Georgie, the Yankee Doodle Dandy, just failed to
make it. Irish wit and an extraordinary aptitude for
putting into simple song the most obvious of jingo
sentiments were not quite enough. The situation
which Cohan faced at the time was beginning to be
complicated: the ballad song was becoming a bore;
the substitutes for it had failed to absorb rhythms
fresh enough and swift enough to please the public.
And between dawn and daylight ragtime was upon
us.</p>

<p><i>Enfin</i> Berlin <i>vient</i>! How much ragtime had been
sung and played before, no man may calculate; it
had been heard in every minstrel show, and its
musical elements were thoroughly familiar. What
was needed was a crystallization, was one song
which should take the whole dash and energy of
ragtime and carry it to its apotheosis; with a characteristic
turn of mind Berlin accomplished this in
a song which had no other topic than ragtime itself.
<i>Alexander’s Ragtime Band</i> appeared with its bow
to negro music and its introduction of <i>Swanee River</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
it was simple and passionate and utterly unsentimental
and the whole country responded to its masterful
cry, <i>Come on and hear!</i> Presently <i>Waiting
for the Robert E. Lee</i> is heard—a levee song and
one would say that the South had already conquered;
but Berlin is first of all a writer of rag and the
Southern theme is dropped (the negro music remaining)
while he gives the world two further dazzling
rags: <i>The International</i> and <i>The Ragtime Violin</i>.
Everybody’s doing it was true of singing and dancing
and—composing. For the day which was awakened
with <i>Alexander’s Ragtime Band</i> was a day of extraordinary
energy and <i>Skeleton Rags</i> and <i>Yiddische Rags</i>
and <i>Pullman Porters’ Balls</i>, and everything that
could be syncopated, and most things that could not,
paid their quota to ragtime. There have been periods
equally definable: the time of the waltz song, of the
ballad, of jazz. What makes the first rag period
important was its intense gaiety, its naïveté, its tireless
curiosity about itself, its unconscious destruction
of the old ballad form and the patter song.
The music drove ahead; the half-understood juggling
with tempo which was to become the characteristic
of our music led to fresh accents, a dislocation
of the beat, and to a greater freedom in the text.
For half a century syncopation had existed in America,
anticipating the moment when the national spirit
should find in it its perfect expression; for that half
century serious musicians had neglected it; they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
to study it a decade later when ragtime had revealed
it to them.</p>

<p>The early rags were made to be sung and they
were sung, universally. What the departing queen
of Hawaii offered in <i>Aloha Ohe</i> was swiftly integrated
into the existing form and <i>On the Beach at
Wai-ki-ki</i> is a rag in every respect, using material
which is foreign only in appearance. (The fact that
ragtime can without offense adapt the folk song of
nearly every nation—and is only absurd with Puccini
and Verdi’s worst when it takes them seriously—indicates
how essentially decent an art ragtime is.)
The nostalgia which later came into Hawaiian songs
does not exist in this first greatly popular song of
those islands any more than it exists in the <i>Robert E.
Lee</i> or in <i>When that Midnight Chu-chu Leaves for
Alabam’</i>. Berlin himself was not untouched by the
Hawaiian scene and in <i>The Hula-Hula</i> he wrote a
song superior, in my mind, to <i>Wai-ki-ki</i>, yet never
popular in the great sense. The rush and excitement
of <i>Wai-ki-ki</i> aren’t in <i>The Hula-Hula</i>; some one had
told too much about the undulations of the dance
and the sensuousness of the southern Pacific. Louis
Hirsch, years later, did the same thing in <i>’Neath the
South Sea Moon</i>, a respectable piece of work. But it
remained for Jerome Kern, a decade and more after
<i>Wai-ki-ki</i>, to make another Hawaiian song popular.
This was <i>Ka-lu-a</i> (out of <i>Good Morning, Dearie</i>)
and in every way it showed cleverness and intelligence.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
For it was not a song of Hawaii at all. It
was produced in an Englishy garden, sung by women
in hoopskirts surrounding Oscar Shaw in evening
clothes; and it is all, all a longing for—I think it is
a longing for Wai-ki-ki the song, as much as for the
beach. The old romantic properties are in the words,
slightly set off in mockery by the premature and
internal rhymes; they are suffused with memory and
the music is purely nostalgic. It was not for nothing
that Mr Kern wrote <i>The Siren Song</i>.</p>

<p>The moment Hawaii faded out nothing was left
but the South, and here the music began to drive the
words with a hard hand and a high check. An observer
unfamiliar with the nature of ragtime would
conclude that the American people had a complex
about nigger mammies and that the sublimation
thereof was in the popular song. The true explanation
is simpler. The mother element is, of course, a
sure-fire hit in the pictures and in song; but the
nigger mammy enters for the same reason as cotton
fields and pickaninnies and Georgia—because our
whole present music is derived from the negro and
most composers of popular songs haven’t yet discovered
that the musical structure is applicable to other
themes as well. (George Gershwin’s <i>Walking Home
with Angeline</i> in <i>Our Nell</i>, Cole Porter’s <i>Blue Boy
Blues</i>, about the Gainsborough painting, and Berlin’s
<i>Pack Up Your Sins and Go to the Devil</i> are examples
of the transfer successfully accomplished, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
gratifying, too. Best of all is <i>Limehouse Blues</i>, by
Philip Braham, a veritable masterpiece in the <i>genre</i>.)
There exist a number of natural themes—slavery,
the local scene (Swanee River), the cabin, the food,
and the train whereby one arrives. The genius of
Tin Pan Alley has worked upon this material, and
in both words and music has been amazingly imitative,
uninventive, and dull. Yet the idea of taking
a theme and so handling it that the slightest variation
from the preceding use of the same material
shall give the effect of novelty and freshness is a
sound one—we know from the history of Greek
drama. Alas! there was little novelty and the tradition
was never firm enough to bear what they did
to it. Yet they had their reward, if they can accept
it vicariously, for one of them, not at the beginning
and not at the end, which is not yet, took the old
material and fashioned a great song. His name is
George Gershwin and the song which, before the
blue-jazz age, achieves pre-eminence is <i>Swanee</i>. To
have heard Al Jolson sing this song is to have had
one of the few great experiences which the minor
arts are capable of giving; to have heard it without
feeling something obscure and powerful and rich
with a separate life of its own coming into being,
is—I should say it is not to be alive. The verse is
simple and direct, with faint foreshadowings of the
subtly divided, subtly compounded elements of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>chorus where the name “Swanee,” with a strong beat,
long drawn and tender, ushers in the swift passages
leading to the repetition, slow again, of the name;
and the rest of the song is the proper working out of
a problem in contrasting cadences, and in dynamics.
After the chorus, and in another key, there is a coda,
a restatement of the theme with a little more restraint,
and then, surprisingly and gratefully, for the
first time the introduction of the final bars of <i>Swanee
River</i>. I analyze this song as if it could be taken
apart and the essence of it remain; the truth is that
it bears inspection and is worth inspection because it
has a strongly individual quality, a definite personal
touch. Mr Gershwin has progressed<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> in his technical
handling of syncopation, as in <i>Innocent Ingénue
Baby</i> (not primarily a song to be sung or for the
dance, but to hear; it is musically the solution of a
problem in pauses, and the answer is delicious); but
in <i>Swanee</i> he is at his highest point, for he has taken
the simple emotion of longing and let it surge through
his music, he has made real what a hundred before
him had falsified. He should “do it again.”</p>

  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">Irving Berlin</span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Swanee</i> was popular, but by no means as popular
as <i>Some Sunny Day</i>, a song by Mr Berlin which will
simply not bear analysis. I hold Mr Berlin to be
still the foremost writer of popular music in spite of
it. Three years and a masterly technique separate
the two songs and <i>Some Sunny Day</i> is devilishly
clever, but most of it isn’t properly singable. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
a good dance tune; analyzed, it resolves itself into
a weak treatment of <i>Old Black Joe</i> (clever Mr Berlin
to take the first bar of the old <i>verse</i> for the first
bar of his <i>chorus</i>) and a regrettable quotation again
of <i>Swanee River</i>. The arrangement is neat, and the
inversion of the first bar halfway through the chorus,
when the song has dribbled into meaningless fragments,
has lost all intensity and is suddenly revived
and refreshed, while the words of the first bar are
repeated—that sufficiently indicates the master hand.
The words are among Mr Berlin’s weakest and it is
hard to believe that at the same moment he was
revelling in the two <i>Music Box Revues</i>, in <i>Say It
With Music</i> and <i>Pack Up Your Sins</i>, which are
superb.</p>

<p>It is not entirely an accident that a consideration
of the effect of ragtime on popular song begins and
ends with Irving Berlin. For as surely as <i>Alexander’s
Ragtime Band</i> started something, <i>Pack Up Your
Sins</i> is a sign that it is coming to an end. For this
tremendous piece of music simply cannot be sung; it
baffled the trained chorus on its first appearance, it
can hardly be whistled through, and, although the
words are good, they aren’t known. Ragtime is now
written for jazz orchestra; three phrases occupy the
time of two; four, five, and even six notes the time
of two or three. The words which are becoming
wittier than ever are too numerous, too jostled, to
be sung, and the melodic structure with arbitrarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
changing beat baffles the voice and the mind as much
as it intrigues the pulse and the heel. The popular
song and the ragtime song are vanishing temporarily.
But something terrible and wonderful has already
taken their place. Already there is an indication of
how they will return and—I am tired of speaking of
Mr Berlin, but I can’t help it—Mr Berlin has indicated
how and where. His <i>All by Myself</i> is in
essence a combination of the sentimental song with
ragtime—so it was sung by Ethel Levey. And it is
played with enthusiasm by jazz orchestras—a perceptible
pleasure is ours from recognizing something
entirely simple and sentimental weaving its way
through those recondite harmonies.</p>

<p>If the song returns in any way the ancient protest
against its vulgarity will also return, and it is
worth making up our minds about it now. The popular
song takes its place between the folk song and
the art song. Of these the folk song hardly exists in
America to-day: <i>Casey Jones</i> and <i>Frankie and Johnny</i>
are examples of what we possess and one doesn’t
often hear them sung along country roads or by
brown-armed men at the rudder in ships that go
down to the sea. The songs of the Kentucky mountains
(English in provenance) and the old cowboy
songs are both the object of antiquarian interest—they
aren’t as alive as the universal <i>Hail, Hail, the
Gang’s All Here</i> or <i>We Won’t Go Home ’til Morning</i>.
If we refuse to call our ragtime folk music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
then we must face the fact that we are at a moment
in history when folk songs simply do not occur.
(Even the war failed to give us very much; it is
interesting to note that besides <i>Katy</i> and <i>Mr Zip</i>,
the songs written by the best and most expert of our
composers, Berlin and Cohan, were both meant to be
sung and were sung—and this took place in the
midst of the change to the unsingable type.) At the
opposite extreme is the art song—usually the setting
and degradation of a poem written for its own sake
and usually—let us say dull. The composers of art
songs are about fifty paces behind the symphonists
and the symphonists are nearly nowhere. The result
is that we aren’t in any sense <i>nourished</i> by the writers
of art songs and, since we are a musical people, for
better or for worse we fall back on the popular song.
It is to me a question whether we would be better
citizens and more noble in the sight of God if we
sang <i>Narcissus</i> instead of <i>The Girl on the Magazine
Cover</i>.</p>

<p>Once in a while something between the art and
the popular song appears, and it is called <i>My Rosary</i>
or <i>The End of a Perfect Day</i>, and it is unbearable.
Because here you have a pretentiousness, a base desire
to be above the crowd and yet to please (it is called
“uplift,” but it does not mean exalt) the crowd; here
is the touch of “art” which makes all things false
and vulgar. To be sure, these songs, too, are popular;
the desire for culture is as universal as it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
depressing. And these are the only popular songs
which are really vulgar. I will ask no one to compare
them with the real thing. Compare them with
false, trivial, ridiculous imitations of the real thing—it
exists in some of the occasional songs which
composers are always trying and which hardly ever
come off. I recall a song written about the Iroquois
fire; another about Harry K. Thaw (“Just because
he’s a millionaire, Everybody’s willing to treat him
unfair”). Only the two songs about Caruso succeeded,
and there never was a good one about Roosevelt.
Here is one written for Jackie Coogan in
<i>Oliver Twist</i>:</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> word jazz is already so complicated that it
ought not to be subjected to any new definitions,
and the thing itself so familiar that it is useless to
read new meanings into it. Jazz is a type of music
grown out of ragtime and still ragtime in essence;
it is also a method of production and as such an
orchestral development; and finally it is the symbol,
or the byword, for a great many elements in the spirit
of the time—as far as America is concerned it is
actually our characteristic expression. This is recognized
by Europeans; with a shudder by the English
and with real joy by the French, who cannot, however,
play it.</p>

<p>The fact that jazz is our current mode of expression,
has reference to our time and the way we think
and talk, is interesting; but if jazz music weren’t
itself good the subject would be more suitable for a
sociologist than for an admirer of the gay arts. Fortunately,
the music and the way it is played are both
of great interest, both have qualities which cannot
be despised; and the cry that jazz is the enthusiastic
disorganization of music is as extravagant as the
prophecy that if we do not stop “jazzing” we will go
down, as a nation, into ruin. I am quite ready to
uphold the contrary. If—before we have produced
something better—we give up jazz we shall be sacrificing
nearly all there is of gaiety and liveliness
and rhythmic power in our lives. Jazz, for us, isn’t
a last feverish excitement, a spasm of energy before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
death. It is the normal development of our resources,
the expected, and wonderful, arrival of America at a
point of creative intensity.</p>

<p>Jazz is good—at least good jazz is good—and I
propose to summarize some of the known reasons for
holding it so. The summary will take me far from
the thing one hears and dances to, from the thing
itself. The analysis of jazz, musically or emotionally,
is not likely to be done in the spirit of jazz
itself. There isn’t room on the printed page for a
glissando on the trombone, for the sweet sentimental
wail of the saxophone, or the sudden irruptions of
the battery. Nor is there need for these—intellectually
below the belt—attacks. The reason jazz is
worth writing about is that it is worth listening to.
I have heard it said by those who have suffered much
that it is about the only native music worth listening
to in America.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, jazz music is a new development—something
of the last two years, arriving long
after jazz had begun to be played. I mean that
ragtime is now so specifically written for the jazz
band that it is acquiring new characteristics. Zez
Confrey, Irving Berlin, Fred Fisher, and Walter
Donaldson, among others, are creating their work as
jazz; the accent in each bar, for example, is marked
in the text—the classic idea of the slight accent on
the first note of each bar went out when ragtime
came in; then ragtime created its own classic notion,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
propulsion of the accent from the first (strong)
note to the second (weak). In jazz ragtime the
accent can occur anywhere in the bar and is attractively
unpredictable. Rhythmically—essentially—jazz
is ragtime, since it is based on syncopation, and
even without jazz orchestration we should have had
the full employment of precise and continuous syncopation
which we find in jazz now, in <i>Pack Up
Your Sins</i>, for example. It is syncopation, too, which
has so liberated jazz from normal polyphony, from
perfect chords, that M Darius Milhaud is led to
expect from jazz a full use of polytonic and atonic
harmonies; he notes that in <i>Kitten on the Keys</i> there
exists already a chord of the perfect major and the
perfect minor. The reason why syncopation lies
behind all this is that it is fundamentally an anticipation
or a suspension in one instrument (or in the
bass) of what is going to happen in another (the
treble); and the moment in which a note occurs prematurely
or in retard is, frequently, a moment of
discord on the strong beat. A dissonance sets in
which may or may not be resolved later. The regular
use of syncopation, therefore, destroyed the fallacy
(as I hold it) of the perfect ear; and this is one
reason why Americans are often readier to listen to
modern music than peoples who haven’t got used to
dissonance in their folk and popular music.</p>

<p>It is not only syncopation that makes us indebted
to negro music. Another element is the typical chord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
structure found there, the characteristic variations
from the accustomed. Technically described, one of
the most familiar is the subdominant seventh chord
with the interval of a minor instead of a major
seventh—a method of lowering the leading tone
which affects so distant a piece as <i>A Stairway to
Paradise</i>, where the accented syllable of Par´-adise is
skilfully lowered. (By extension ragtime also uses
the “diminished third.”) The succession of dominant
sevenths and of ninths is another characteristic, and
the intrusion of tones which lie outside of our normal
piano scale is common.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Still another attack on the
perfect chord comes from the use of the instruments
of the jazz band, one for which ragtime had well
prepared us. The notorious slide of the trombone,
now repeated in the slide of the voice, means inevitably
that in its progress to the note which will make
an harmonious chord, the instrument passes through
discords. “Smears,” as they are refreshingly called,
are the deadliest enemy of the classic tradition, for
the ear becomes so accustomed to discords in transition
that it ceases to mind them. (We hear them,
of course; the pedants are wrong to say that we will
cease to appreciate the “real value” of a discord if
we aren’t pained by it and don’t leave the hall when
one is played without resolution.) In contemporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
ragtime, it should be noted, the syncopation of the
tonality—playing your b-flat in the bass just before
it occurs in the voice, let us say—is often purely a
method of warning, an indication of the direction
the melody is to take.</p>

<p>I put the strange harmonies of jazz first, not
because they are its chief characteristic, but because
of the prejudice against them. The suggestion is
current that they are sounds which ought never to be
uttered; and with this goes an attack on the trick
instruments, the motor-horns, of the battery-man.
The two things have nothing in common. The instruments
of the jazz band are wholly legitimate and
its characteristic instrument was invented by a German,
after whom it is named, in the middle of the
last century, and has been used in serious music by
(and since) Meyerbeer—I refer to the saxophone.
There is no more legal objection to the muted trombone
than to the violin <i>con sordino</i>. And the opponents
of jazz bands will do well to remember that
the pure and lovely D-minor symphony of César
Franck was thrown out as a symphony because it
used the English horn. The actual sounds produced
by the jazz band are entirely legitimate. We have
yet to see what use they make of them.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Krehbiel’s book the whole question of rhythm
is comparatively taken for granted, as it should be.
Syncopation discovered in classic music, in the Scot’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
snap of the Strathspey reel, in Hungarian folk music,
is characteristic of three-fifths of the negro songs
which Krehbiel analyzed (exactly the same proportion,
by the way, as are in the interval of the ordinary
<i>major</i>). But it is such a normal phenomenon that I
have never found a composer to be interested in it.
Krehbiel, to be sure, does refer to the “degenerate
form” of syncopation which is the basis of our ragtime,
and that is hopeful because it indicates that
ragtime is a development—intensification, sophistication—of
something normal in musical expression.
The free use of syncopation has led our good composers
of ragtime and jazz to discoveries in rhythm
and to a mastery of complications which one finds
elsewhere only in the great composers of serious
music. In describing the Dahoman war dances at
the Chicago World’s Fair, Krehbiel says:</p>

<p>“Berlioz in his supremest effort with his army of
drummers produced nothing to compare <i>in artistic
interest</i> with the harmonious drumming of these savages.
The fundamental effect was a combination of
double and triple time, the former kept by the
singers, the latter by the drummers, but it is impossible
to convey the idea of the wealth of detail
achieved by the drummers by means of exchange of
the rhythms, syncopation of both simultaneously, and
dynamic devices.”</p>

<p>The italics are mine. I am fully aware of the difference
between savage and sophisticated, between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
folk music and popular music; yet I cannot help believing
that this entire statement, including the Berlioz
whom I greatly admire, could be applied to Paul
Whiteman playing <i>Pack Up Your Sins</i> or his incredible
mingling of <i>A Stairway to Paradise</i> with a sort
of <i>Beale Street Blues</i>.</p>

<p>Freedom with rhythm is audible—should I say
palpable?—everywhere. <i>Stumbling</i> (Zez Confrey)
is in effect a waltz played against a more rapid
counter-rhythm, and is interesting also for its fixed
groups of uneven notes—triplets with the first note
held or omitted for a time, and then with the third
note omitted. A similar effect with other means occurs
in the treatment of three notes in <i>Innocent Ingénue
Baby</i>, by George Gershwin, where the same note falls
under a different beat with a delightful sense of surprise
and uncertainty. Mr Hooker’s words are
equally tricky, for it isn’t “Innocent-Ingénue-Baby”
at all; it is Innocent Ingénue (<i>baby</i>). In <i>By and By</i>
Gershwin has shifted an accent from the first to the
second simply by giving the second the time-value
usually given to the first, a fresh, delightful treatment
of a sentimental expression. The variety of
method is vastly interesting. Louis Hirsch, whom I
rank fairly low as a composer for jazz, has done perfectly
one obvious, necessary thing: stopped syncopating
in the middle of a piece of ragtime. In the
phrase “shake and shimmy everywhere” in <i>It’s Getting
Very Dark on Old Broadway</i>, he presents the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
whole-tone scale descending in two bars of full unsyncopated
quarter-notes. In the works of Zez Confrey
(they are issued with a snobbish tasty cover,
rather like the works of Claude Debussy) the syncopation
and the exploitation of concurrent, apparently
irreconcilable rhythms is first exasperating and eventually
exciting. They are specifically piano pieces
and require a brilliant proficiency to render them.</p>

<p>It is a little difficult, unless one has the piano
score, to determine what part is the work of the composer,
what of the jazz orchestra. You can only be
fairly certain that whatever melody occurs is the composer’s,
and that rhythmically he is followed with
some fidelity. All you need to do is to listen to the
violin, piano, or whatever instrument it is which holds
the beat, to realize what the composer has given.
Harmonization is often, and orchestration nearly always,
left to other hands. Mr Berlin makes a habit
now of giving credit to his chief collaborator, and
he deserves it.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Mr Berlin’s masterpieces (June, 1923, but who
shall say?) in jazz are <i>Everybody Step</i> and <i>Pack
Up Your Sins</i>. I have written so much about him in
connexion with song and shows that I can say little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
more. I see no letting down of his energy, none in
his inventiveness. He is, oddly, one of the simplest
of our composers. A good way to estimate his capacity
is to play the more sentimental songs (<i>I’m Gonna
Pin My Medal on the Girl I Left Behind</i>, <i>Someone
Else May Be There While I’m Gone</i>, <i>All by Myself</i>)
in slow time and then in fast. The amazing way they
hold together in each tempo, the way in which the
sentiment, the flow of the melody, disengages itself in
the slow, and then the rhythm, the beat takes first
place in the fast time, is exceptional. You cannot
do the same with his own <i>Some Sunny Day</i>, nor with
<i>Chicago</i> or <i>Carolina in the Morning</i>. Berlin’s work
is musically interesting, and that means it has a
chance to survive. I have no such confidence in <i>Dardanella</i>
or <i>Chicago</i>. The famous unmelodic four
notes occur in the latter as in <i>Pack Up Your Sins</i> (the
source is the same, but we need not go into that);
the working out is vastly inferior. Fred Fisher’s
work is sledge hammer in comparison with Berlin’s,
and lacks Berlin’s humour. Of that quality Walter
Donaldson has some, and Gershwin much. Donaldson
wrote Al Jolson’s <i>Mammy</i> (I can’t remember
which, but I’m afraid I didn’t like it), and a song I
count heavily on: <i>Carolina in the Morning</i>. This
song is, incidentally, a startling example of how jazz
is improving the lyrics, for the majority of jazz songs
are not meant primarily for singing, so the balladists
take liberties, and not being held to a definite end-rhyme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
give us “strolling with your girlie when the
dew is pearly early in the morning.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The music is
clean, rapid, and audacious. It carries the introduction
(of the chorus) almost to the point of exhaustion,
suspending the resolution of its phrases until the last
possible moment, and then lets go, with a vast relief
on the long, somewhat yodelly note. Confrey has
done the same thing in <i>Kitten on the Keys</i> where one
bar is repeated five times with successive tightening
of interest.</p>

<div id="i_092" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_092.jpg" width="1196" height="1515" alt="" />
  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">George Gershwin</span></div>
</div>

<p>Two composers are possible successors to Berlin
if he ever chooses to stop. I omit Jerome Kern—a
consideration of musical style will indicate why. I
am sure of Gershwin and would be more sure of Cole
Porter if his astonishing lyrics did not so dazzle me
as to make me distrust my estimate of his music.
Gershwin is in Berlin’s tradition; he has almost all
the older man’s qualities as a composer (not as a
lyrics writer; nor has he Berlin’s sense of a song on
the stage). That is to say, Gershwin is capable of
everything, from <i>Swanee</i> to <i>A Stairway to Paradise</i>.
His sentiment is gentler than Berlin’s, his “attack”
more delicate. Delicacy, even dreaminess, is a quality
he alone brings into jazz music. And his sense of
variation in rhythm, of an oddly placed accent, of
emphasis and colour, is impeccable. He isn’t of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
stage, yet, so he lacks Berlin’s occasional bright
hardness; he never has Berlin’s smartness; and with a
greater musical knowledge he seems possessed of an
insatiable interest and curiosity. I feel I can bank
on him. Banking on Porter is dangerous because essentially
he is much more sophisticated in general
attitude of mind than any of the others, and although
he has written ragtime and patter songs and jazz of
exceptional goodness, he has one quality which may
bar him forever from the highest place—I mean that
he is essentially a parodist. I know of no one else
with such a sense for musical styles. A blues, a 1910
rag, a Savoy operetta serio-comic love song, a mother
song—he writes them all with a perfect feeling for
their musical nature, and almost always with satiric
intention, with a touch of parody. It is only the most
sophisticated form which is germane to him; in highly
complex jazzing he is so much at home, his curiosity
is so engaged, he feels the problem so much, that the
element of parody diminishes. Yet <i>The Blue Boy
Blues</i>, almost as intricate a thing as Berlin ever wrote,
with a melody overlaid on a running syncopated comment,
has a slight touch of parody in the very excess
of its skill. Jazz has always mocked itself a little;
it is possible that it will divide and follow two strains—the
negro and the intellectual. In the second case
Porter will be one of its leaders and Whiteman will
be his orchestra. The song <i>Soon</i>, for example, is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
deliberate annihilation of the Southern negro sentiment
carefully done by playing Harlem jazz, with a
Harlem theme, mercilessly burlesquing the <i>clichés</i> of
the Southern song—the Swanee-Mammy element—in
favour of a Harlem alley. Porter’s parody is almost
too facile; <i>Soon</i> is an exasperatingly good piece
of jazz in itself. He is a tireless experimenter, and
the fact that in 1923 others are doing things he tried
in 1919, makes me wonder whether his excessive intelligence
and sophistication may not be pointing a
way which steadier and essentially more <i>native</i> jazz
writers will presently follow. Native, I mean, to
jazz; taking it more seriously. Whether any of them
could compose such a ballet as Porter did for the
Ballet Suédois is another question.</p>

<p>The other way is still open—the way of Sissle and
Blake, of Creamer and Layton, of A. Harrington
Gibbs. The last is a name unknown to me ten days
before the moment of writing; I do not know if it
represents a Southern negro or a Welshman. But—if
he has composed anything, if <i>Runnin’ Wild</i> isn’t a
direct transcript of a negro devil-tune—he is in the
school of the negro composers and he has accomplished
wonders already. For <i>Runnin’ Wild</i> is a
masterpiece in its <i>genre</i>. Note the cleverness of the
execution: the melody is virtually without accompaniment;
it consists of groups of three notes, the interval
of time being simple, and the interval of pitch in the
group or between two successive groups, is quite conventional.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Once three groups of three notes are
played in succession; toward the end the group is
twice lengthened to four notes; the orchestra is heard
after each group has been sung, giving an unnerving
effect of alternating sound and silence. But there is
something more: There is the complete evocation of
the two negro spirits—the darky (South, slave) and
the buck (Harlem); the negro and the nigger. It
ends with a shout which is lyrical and ecstatic at once,
wild and free. It is an enchantingly gay piece, it expresses
its title—one sees our own Gilda Grey stepping
out in it bravely; it is, in a way, a summary of
the feeling of negro music which <i>Shuffle Along</i> and
its followers restored to prominence.</p>

<p>More must be said of the negro side of jazz than I
can say here. Its technical interest hasn’t yet been
discussed by anyone sufficiently expert and sufficiently
enthusiastic at the same time. In words and
music the negro side expresses something which
underlies a great deal of America—our independence,
our carelessness, our frankness, and gaiety. In each
of these the negro is more intense than we are, and we
surpass him when we combine a more varied and more
intelligent life with his instinctive qualities. <i>Aggravatin’
Papa</i> (don’t you try to two-time me) isn’t exactly
the American response to a suspected infidelity,
yet it is humanly sound, and is only a little more
simple and savage than we are. The superb <i>I’m Just
Wild about Harry</i> is, actually, closer to the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
feeling of 1922 than “I Always dream of Bill”; as
expression it is more honest than, say, <i>Beautiful Garden
of Roses</i>; and <i>He May be Your Man</i> is simply
a letting down of our reticences, a frankness beyond
us.</p>

<p>I shift between the two teams, Sissle and Blake,
Creamer and Layton, uncertain which has most to
give. Sissle and Blake wrote <i>Shuffle Along</i>; the
others accomplished the intricate, puzzling rhythm of
<i>Sweet Angelina</i>, one or two other songs in <i>Strut Miss
Lizzie</i>, and <i>Come Along, I’m through with Worrying</i>.
Of this song a special word can be said. It is based on
<i>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot</i>, and imposes on that
melody a negro theme (the shiftlessness and assurance
of “bound to live until I die”) and a musical
structure similar to that applied to the same original
by Anton Dvořak in the <i>New World Symphony</i>. I
am only a moderate admirer of this work; I am not
trying to put <i>Come Along</i> into the same category, for
its value is wholly independent of its comparative
merits; nor am I claiming that jazz is equal to or
greater or less than symphonic music. But I do feel
that the treatment of a negro melody, by negroes, to
make a popular and beautiful song for Americans
ought not to be always neglected, always despised. I
say also that our serious composers have missed so
much in not seeing what the ragtime composers have
done, that (like Lady Bracknell) they ought to be
exposed to comment on the platform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>If they cannot hear the almost unearthly cry of
the <i>Beale Street Blues</i> I can only be sorry for them;
the whole of Handy’s work is melodically of the
greatest interest and is to me so versatile, so changing,
in quality, that I am incapable of suggesting its
elements. Observed in the works of others, the blues
retain some of this elusive nature—they are equivocal
between simplicity, sadness, irony, and something approaching
frenzy. The original negro spiritual has
had more respect, but the elements have been sparsely
used, and one fancies that even in looking at these
our serious composers have felt the presence of a
regrettable vulgarity in syncopation and in melodic
line. <i>Jesus Heal’ de Sick</i> is negro from the Bahamas;
its syncopation, its cry, “Bow low!” are repeated in
any number of others; the spirituals themselves were
often made out of the common songs in which common
feeling rose to intense and poetic expression—as
in <i>Round About de Mountain</i>, a funeral song with
the Resurrection in a magnificent phrase, “An she’ll
rise in His arms.” The only place we have these
things left, whether you call the present version debased
or sophisticated, gain or loss, is in ragtime, in
jazz. I do <i>not</i> think that the negro (in African
plastic or in American rag) is our salvation. But he
has kept alive things without which our lives would
be perceptibly meaner, paler, and nearer to atrophy
and decay.</p>

<p>I say the negro is not our salvation because with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
all my feeling for what he instinctively offers, for his
desirable indifference to our set of conventions about
emotional decency, I am on the side of civilization.
To anyone who inherits several thousand centuries of
civilization, none of the things the negro offers can
matter unless they are apprehended by the mind as
well as by the body and the spirit. The beat of the
tom-tom affects the feet and the pulse, I am sure; in
<i>Emperor Jones</i> the throbbing of the drum affected
our minds and our sensibilities at once. There will
always exist wayward, instinctive, and primitive
geniuses who will affect us directly, without the interposition
of the intellect; but if the process of civilization
continues (will it? I am not so sure, nor
entirely convinced that it should) the greatest art is
likely to be that in which an uncorrupted sensibility
is <i>worked</i> by a creative intelligence. So far in their
music the negroes have given their response to the
world with an exceptional naïveté, a directness of
expression which has interested <i>our</i> minds as well as
touched our emotions; they have shown comparatively
little evidence of the functioning of <i>their</i> intelligence.
<i>Runnin’ Wild</i>, whether it be transposed or
transcribed, is singularly instinctive, and instinctively
one recognizes it and makes it the musical motif
of a gay night. But one falls back on <i>Pack Up Your
Sins</i> and <i>Soon</i> as more interesting pieces of music even
if one can whistle only the first two bars. (I pass
the question of falling farther back, to the music of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
high seriousness, which is another matter; it is quite
possible, however, that the <i>Sacre du Printemps</i> of
Strawinsky, to choose an example not unaffected by
the jazz age, will outlive the marble monument of
the Music Box.)</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Nowhere is the failure of the negro to exploit his
gifts more obvious than in the use he has made of
the jazz orchestra; for although nearly every negro
jazz band is better than nearly every white band, no
negro band has yet come up to the level of the best
white ones, and the leader of the best of all, by a
little joke, is called Whiteman. The negro’s instinctive
feeling for colourful instruments in the band is
marked; he was probably the one to see what could
be done with the equivocal voice of the saxophone—a
reed in brass, partaking of the qualities of two
choirs in the orchestra at once. He saw that it could
imitate the voice, and in the person of Miss Florence
Mills saw that the voice could equally imitate the
saxophone. The shakes, thrills, vibratos, smears, and
slides are natural to him, although they produce tones
outside the scale, because he has never been tutored
into a feeling for perfect tones, as white men have;
and he uses these with a great joy in the surprise they
give, in the way they adorn or destroy a melody; he
is given also to letting instruments follow their own
bent, because he has a faultless sense of rhythm and
he always comes out right in the end. But this is only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
the beginning of the jazz band—for its perfection
we go afield.</p>

<p>We go farther than Ted Lewis, whom Mr Walter
Haviland calls a genius. M Darius Milhaud has
told me that the jazz band at the Hotel Brunswick
in Boston is one of the best he heard in America, and
stranger things have happened. The best of the
negro bands (although he is dead, I make exception
for that superb 369th Hell-fighters Infantry Band as
it was conducted by the lamented Jim Europe) are
probably in the neighborhood of 140th street and
Lenox avenue in New York and in the negro district
of Chicago. Many hotels and night clubs in New
York have good jazz bands; I limit myself to three
which are representative, and, by their frequent appearances
in vaudeville, are familiar. Ted Lewis is
one of the three; Vincent Lopez and Paul Whiteman
are the others. There is a popular band led by Barney
Bernie (as I recall the name, perhaps incorrectly)
which is an imitation Ted Lewis, and not a good one.
Lewis must be prepared for imitators, for he does
with notorious success something that had as well not
be done at all. He is totally, but brilliantly, wrong
in the use of his materials, for he is doing what he
cannot do—<i>i.e.</i>, trying to make a negro jazz orchestra.
It is a good band; like Europe’s, it omits strings; it
is quite the noisiest of the orchestras, as that of Lopez
is the quietest, and Lewis uses its (and his) talents
for the perpetration of a series of musical travesties,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
jokes, puns, and games. I quote a eulogy by Mr
Haviland:<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For instance, there is his travesty of the marriage ceremony.
To the jazzed tune of the good old classic “Wedding March”
Lewis puts a snowy, flower-decked bridal veil on the sleek,
pomaded head of the trombone player. He puts it on crooked,
with a scornful flip of his slender, malicious hands. Then he
leads forward the hardest-looking saxophone player, and pretends
to marry “Ham” and “Eggs”—and incidentally draws
the correct conclusion as to marriage as it exists in America
to-day. Perfect satire in less than three minutes.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, this is extraordinarily tedious and would be
hissed off the stage if it were not for the actual skill
Lewis has in effecting amusing orchestra combinations.
His own violence, his exaggeration of the
temperamental conductor, his nasal voice and lean
figure in excessively odd black clothes, his pontificating
over the orchestra, his announcement that he is
going to murder music—all indicate a lack of appreciation
of the medium. He may be a good vaudeville
stunt, but he is not a great jazz leader. Again Mr
Haviland:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is not music. It has the form of music, but he has filled
it with energy instead of spirituality. What is the difference?
You’ll understand if you hear his jazz band. It interprets
the American life of to-day; its hard surface, its scorn of tradition,
its repudiation of form, its astonishing sophistication—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
most important, its mechanical, rather than spiritual
civilization.</p>
</div>

<p>And again no. Lewis may have a perfectly
trained orchestra, but the <i>sense</i> of control which one
absolutely requires he does not give. He has violence,
not energy, and he cannot interpret those qualities
which Mr Haviland so justly discovers as being
of our contemporary life because he isn’t hard and
scornful and sophisticated himself—he is merely
callous to some beauties and afraid of others, and by
dint of being in revolt against a serene and classic
beauty pays it unconscious tribute. (I fear also that
Lewis imagines the “Wedding March” classic in more
senses than one.) It may be noted also that the tone
of travesty is not correct for contemporary America;
we require neither that nor irony. Parody, rising to
satire, is our indicated medium—Mr Dooley, not
<i>Ulysses</i>.</p>

<p>The orchestra of Vincent Lopez I take as an example
of the good, workmanlike, competent, inventive,
adequate band. It plays at the Hotel Pennsylvania
and in vaudeville, and although Lopez lacks
the ingenuity of Lewis in sound, he has a greater
sense of the capacities of jazz, and instead of doing a
jazz wedding he takes the entire score of “that infernal
nonsense, <i>Pinafore</i>,” cuts it to five characteristic
fragments, and jazzes it—shall I say mercilessly
or reverently? Because he likes Sullivan and he likes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
jazz. And the inevitable occurs; <i>Pinafore</i> is good and
stands the treatment; jazz is good and loses nothing
by this odd application. The orchestra has verve
and, not being dominated by an excessive personality,
has humour and character of its own. I trust these
moderate words will not conceal a vast admiration.</p>

<p>Jim Europe seemed to have a constructive intelligence
and, had he lived, I am sure he would have
been an even greater conductor than Whiteman. To-day
I know of no second to Whiteman in the complete
exploitation of jazz. It is a real perfection of
the instrument, a mechanically perfect organization
which pays for its perfection by losing much of the
element of surprise; little is left to hazard and there
are no accidents. Whiteman has been clever enough
to preserve the sense of impromptu and his principal
band—that of the Palais Royal in New York—is so
much under control (his and its own) that it can
make the slightest variation count for more than all
the running away from the beat which is common
<i>chez</i> Lewis. Like Karl Muck and Jim Europe,
Whiteman is a bit of a <i>kapellmeister</i>; his beat is regular
or entirely absent; he never plays the music with
his hand, or designs the contours of a melody, or
otherwise <i>acts</i>. I know that people miss these things;
I would miss them gladly a thousand times for what
Whiteman gives in return. I mean that a sudden
bellow or a groan or an improvised cluck is all very
well; but the real surprise is constructive, the real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
thrill is in such a moment as the middle of Whiteman’s
performance of <i>A Stairway to Paradise</i> when
a genuine Blues occurs. That is real intelligence and
the rest—is nowhere. The sleek, dull, rather portly
figure stands before his orchestra, sidewise, almost
somnolent, and listens. A look of the eye, a twitch
of the knee, are his semaphoric signals. Occasionally
he picks up a violin and plays a few bars; but the
work has been done before and he is there only to
know that the results are perfect. And all the time
the band is producing music with fervour and accuracy,
hard and sensitive at once. All the free, the
instinctive, the wild in negro jazz which could be
integrated into his music, he has kept; he has added
to it, has worked his material, until it runs sweetly
in his dynamo, without grinding or scraping. It becomes
the machine which conceals machinery. He
has arrived at one high point of jazz—the highest
until new material in the music is provided for him.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The title of this essay is provoked by that of the
best and bitterest attack launched against the ragtime
age—Clive Bell’s <i>Plus de Jazz</i>. (In <i>Since Cézanne</i>.)
“No more jazz,” said Mr Bell in 1921, and, “Jazz is
dying.” Recalling that Mr Bell is at some pains to
dissociate from the movement the greatest of living
painters, Picasso; that he concedes to it a great composer,
Strawinsky, and T. S. Eliot, whom he calls
“about the best of our living poets,” James Joyce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
whom he wofully underestimates, Virginia Woolf,
Cendrars, Picabia, Cocteau, and the musicians of <i>les
six</i>,—remembering the degree of discrimination and
justice which these concessions require, I quote some
of the more bitter things about jazz because it would
be shirking not to indicate where the answer may lie:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Appropriately it (the jazz movement) took its name from
music—the art that is always behind the times.... Impudence
is its essence—impudence in quite natural and legitimate
revolt against nobility and beauty: impudence which finds
its technical equivalent in syncopation: impudence which
rags.... After impudence comes the determination to surprise:
you shall not be gradually moved to the depths, you shall
be given such a start as makes you jigger all over....</p>

<p>... Its fears and dislikes—for instance, its horror of the
noble and the beautiful are childish; and so is its way of
expressing them. Not by irony and sarcasm, but by jeers and
grimaces, does Jazz mark its antipathies. Irony and wit are
for the grown-ups. Jazz dislikes them as much as it dislikes
nobility and beauty. They are the products of the cultivated
intellect and jazz cannot away with intellect or culture....
Nobility, beauty, and intellectual subtlety are alike ruled
out....</p>

<p>... And, of course, it was delightful for those who sat
drinking their cocktails and listening to nigger bands, to be told
that, besides being the jolliest people on earth, they were the
most sensitive and critically gifted. They ... were the possessors
of natural, uncorrupted taste.... Their instinct
might be trusted: so, no more classical concerts and music
lessons....</p>

<p>The encouragement given to fatuous ignorance to swell with
admiration of its own incompetence is perhaps what has turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
most violently so many intelligent and sensitive people against
Jazz. They see that it encourages thousands of the stupid
and vulgar to fancy that they can understand art, and hundreds
of the conceited to imagine that they can create it....</p>
</div>

<p>It is understood that Mr Bell is discussing the
whole of the jazz movement, not ragtime music alone.
I do not wish to go into the other arts, except to say
that if he is jazz, then Mr Joyce’s sense of form, his
tremendous intellectual grasp of his æsthetic problem,
and his solution of that problem, are far more proof
than is required of the case for jazz. Similarly for
Mr Eliot. It is not exactly horror of the noble that
underlies Mr Joyce’s travesty of English prose style,
nor is it to Mr Eliot that the reproach about irony
and wit is to be made. In music it is of course not
impudence, but emphasis (distortion or transposition
of emphasis) which finds its technical equivalent in
syncopation, for syncopation is a method of rendering
an emotion, not an emotion in itself. (Listen to
Strawinsky.) Surprise, yes; but in the jazz of Lewis
and not in that of Whiteman, which does not jeer or
grimace, which has wit and structure—<i>i.e.</i>, employs
the intellect. Nobility—no. But under what compulsion
are we always to be noble? The cocktail
drinkers may have been told a lot of nonsense about
their position as arbiters of the arts; precisely the
same nonsense is taught in our schools and preached
by belated æsthetes to people whose claims are not a
whit better—since it doesn’t matter what their admirers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
think of themselves—it is what jazz and Rostand
and Michelangelo are in themselves that matters.
I have used the word art throughout this book
in connexion with jazz and jazzy things; if anyone
imagines that the word is belittled thereby and can no
longer be adequate to the dignity of Leonardo or
Shakespeare, I am sorry. I do not think I have given
encouragement to “fatuous ignorance” by praising
simple and unpretentious things at the expense of the
fake and the <i>faux bon</i>. I have suggested that people
do what they please about the gay arts, about jazz;
that they do it with discrimination and without
worrying whether it is noble or not, or good form or
intellectually right. I am fairly certain that if they
are ever actually to see Picasso it will be because they
have acquired the habit of seeing—something, anything—without
<i>arrière-pensée</i>, because they will
know what the pleasure is that a work of art can give,
even if it be jazz art. Here is Mr Bell’s conclusion,
with most of which I agree:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even to understand art a man must make a great intellectual
effort. One thing is not as good as another; so artists and
amateurs must learn to choose. No easy matter, that: discrimination
of this sort being something altogether different from
telling a Manhattan from a Martini. To select as an artist
or discriminate as a critic are needed feeling and intellect and—most
distressing of all—study. However, unless I mistake, the
effort will be made. The age of easy acceptance of the first
thing that comes is closing. Thought rather than spirits is required,
quality rather than colour, knowledge rather than irreticence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
intellect rather than singularity, wit rather than romps,
precision rather than surprise, dignity rather than impudence,
and lucidity above all things: <i>plus de Jazz</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>It is not so written, but it sounds like “Above all
things, no more jazz!” A critic who would have hated
jazz as bitterly as Mr Bell does, wrote once, alluding
to a painter of the second rank:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>But, beside those great men, there is a certain number of
artists who have a distinct faculty of their own, by which they
convey to us a peculiar quality of pleasure which we cannot
get elsewhere; and these, too, have their place in general culture,
and must be interpreted to it by those who have felt their charm
strongly, and are often the objects of a special diligence and
a consideration wholly affectionate, just because there is not
about them the stress of a great name and authority.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">—and beside the great arts there is a certain number
of lesser arts which have also a pleasure to give; and
if we savour it strongly and honestly we shall lose
none of our delight in the others. But if we fear and
hate <i>them</i>, how shall we go into the Presence?</p>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> of the most illuminating things Van Wyck
Brooks ever said, about himself, was that Mr Dooley
is already forgotten. It was particularly illuminating
because Mr Brooks was in England when he
made that statement, and it was some time before
1914—and it happens that it was in England, in 1917
that I was made to understand how living Mr Dooley
is, how relevant to affairs and situations of the
moment, and how much English men and women consider
him as one of the better items in the heritage of
Americans. The writer of <i>The Ordeal of Mark
Twain</i> is an invaluable critic for America; yet one
wishes that he, too, could see Mr Dooley’s place in
our literature; one still hopes that he will begin to
enjoy Ring Lardner.</p>

<p>The juxtaposition of these two names would be
reasonable even if both of them did not write in
slang, for one is the greatest of our retired satirists
and the other has every chance (if not every intention)
of becoming the greatest of our active ones. I
should like to say at once that I am not addressing
an open letter to Dear Mr Lardner, bidding him,
while there is yet time, to think on higher things. I
do not want him to forswear for a moment his hold on
the popular imagination, nor to write for a more judicious
<i>clientèle</i>. I am satisfied to have Mr Lardner
amuse me; if the strain of satire in him is an accident
and he prefers to go on with his slang humour—I
can always read Mr Dooley or Dean Swift. But if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
the growing vein of satire in all of Lardner’s work is
what I think it is, he has much to learn from Mr
Dooley. I shall presently come to Mr Dooley and
indicate what it is Lardner can learn in those beautiful
pages; the main thing is that he is probably the
only man in America with the capacity of learning
the lesson of the master, and happily he can learn it
without ceasing for a moment to live in his own
world. I do not wish to force upon him the ordeal of
being worried about.</p>

<p>There may have been a time when Mr Lardner
gave cause for worry. Perhaps when <i>You Know Me,
Al</i> had run as long as it needed to run, one might have
feared that Mr Lardner, having discovered the
American language as his medium, simply didn’t
know what to do with it. If his humour was going
to depend for ever on “1-sided” and “4-taste” and
odd misspellings, it might cease to be funny. It was
necessary, in short, that Mr Lardner should have
something personal to say. He has answered the
question of his future by showing the beginnings of
a first-rate satirist, continuing the tradition of Mark
Twain and Mr Dooley. And having these tentatives
in mind we can begin to look back and wonder
whether he wasn’t always something of a satirist, unconsciously.</p>

<p>The dates may confound my argument, so I will
omit them; substantially Lardner began writing the
letters of a busher just when the more serious magazines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
were exploiting the intellectual idea of “inside
baseball.” Those were the days—and they must
have been funny, we feel <i>circa</i> 1923 when the bought
and sold world’s series and the letters of the fishing
pitcher and suchlike scandal are in our memories,
carefully tucked away because the honour of the
national game is safe in the hands of a dictator—those
were the days when the manager of a baseball
team was regarded as a combination of a captain of
finance (later events rather justified that assumption)
a Freud, and an unborn Einstein. A fine body of college
graduates, clean-living, sport-loving, well-read
boys were the players; and a sport-loving, game-for-the-game’s
sake body of men the enthusiasts. Hughie
Fullerton and Paul Elmer More might be seen any
day in the same column, and John J. McGraw, who
allowed himself to be called Muggsy to show what a
good democrat he was, lunched daily at the President’s
table. Into this pretentious parade Mr
Lardner injected the busher—and baseball has never
recovered. The busher was simply a roughneck and
a fool, a braggart and a liar; he was on occasions a
good ball player, and he seemed to be inflated with
the hot air which had been written about him. He
pricked the bubble, and I do not wonder that Heywood
Broun, despairing of making interesting his accounts
of a recent world’s series, publicly prayed to
God to change places with him for duration. Nothing
short of divine power could save them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>It is a long time since the days of the busher and
when Lardner returned to baseball it was clear that
the subject interested him in no degree, and that he
had changed much as a writer. It is not necessary to
belittle the earlier work; only to note that in 1922
the Lardner touch was much more deft, that the language
was both richer and more accurate, and that he
was continually writing parodies, sometimes of a
phrase, often of a whole style. Three or four of the
reports he wrote for the New York <i>American</i> were
jewels—and, although they had little to do with baseball,
they must have been written in the few hours
which intervene between the end of a game and the
moment of going to press. The whole series of articles
ought to be reprinted; I am limited to snatches from
two of them. The first set the theme: that Lardner
had promised his wife a fur coat from his winnings—he
had bet on the Yankees. The headline was</p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">
Rings’ Mrs.<br />
<i>Outa Luck</i><br />
On Fur Coat
</p>

<p class="in0">and then followed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Well friends you can imagine my surprise and horror when
I found out to-night that the impression had got around some
way another that as soon as this serious was over I was planning
to buy a expensive fur coat for my Mrs. and put a lot
of money into same and buy a coat that would probably run
up into hundreds and hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>Well I did not mean to give no such kind of a impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
and I certainly hope that my little article was not read that way
by everybody a specially around my little home because in the
first place I am not a sucker enough to invest hundreds and
hundreds of dollars in a garment which the chances are that
the Mrs. will not wear it more than a couple times all winter,
as the way it looks now we are libel to have the most openest
winter in history, and if women folks should walk along the st.
in expensive fur coats in the kind of weather which it looks like
we are going to have, why, they would only be laughed at and
any way I believe a couple can have a whole lot better time in
winter staying home and reading a good book or maybe have a
few friends in to play bridge.</p>

<p>Further and more, I met a man at supper last night that
has been in the fur business all his life and ain’t did nothing
you might say only deal in furs and this man says that they are
a great many furs in this world which is reasonable priced that
has got as much warmth in them as high price furs and looks a
great deal better.</p>

<p>For inst. he says that a man is a sucker to invest thousands
and thousands of dollars in expensive furs like Erminie, mule-skin,
squirrel skin and Kerensky when for a hundred dollars, or
not even that much, why a man can buy a owl skin or horse
skin or weasel skin garment that looks like big dough and practically
prostrates people with the heat when they wear them.</p>

<p>So I hope my readers will put a quietus on the silly rumour
that I am planning to plunge in the fur market. I will see that
my Mrs. is dressed in as warm a style as she has been accustomed
to but neither her or I is the kind that likes to make a
big show and go up and down Fifth ave. sweltering in a $700
hog-skin garment in order so as people will turn around and
gap at us. Live and let live is my slocum.</p>
</div>

<p>If this were not funny its secondary qualities
would not be worth noting. The single sentence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
which makes up the second paragraph is a miracle of
condensation, for it contains the whole mind and character
of the individual created behind it (it is not
Ring Lardner, obviously) and at the same time it is a
miracle of the ear, for the rhythm and intonation of
the American spoken language is perfectly caught and
held in it. What is the use of <i>Babbitt</i> in five hundred
pages if we have Lardner in five hundred words?
The fur episode was continued two days later, the
Yankees continuing to lose and three kittens—“three
members of what is sometimes referred to as the feline
tribe”—out at Mr Lardner’s “heavily mortgaged
home in Great Neck ... is practically doomed you
might say ...” because Mr Lardner has met a
man “who has did nothing all his life but sell and
wear fur coats” and who assured him that catskin
garments no bigger than a guest towel were all the
rage and had been seen on “some of the best-dressed
women in New York strolling up and down Tenth
avenue....”</p>

<p>“These 3 little members of the feline tribe is the
cutest and best behaved kitties in all catdom, their
conduct having always been above reproaches outside
of a tendency on the part of Ringer to bite strangers’
knuckles. Nowhere on Long Island is there a more
loveable trio of grimalkins, and how it pierces my
old heart to think that some day next week these 3
little fellows must be shot down like a dog so as their
fur can be fashioned into a warm winter coat for she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
who their antics has so often caused to screech with
laughter.”</p>

<p>The annihilation of the whole Black Beauty-Beautiful
Joe style of writing in the last sentence is
complete, and is accomplished with the retention of
Lardner’s own peculiarities. It may shock Mr Lardner
to know that he has done in little what Mr
Joyce has done on the grand scale in <i>Ulysses</i>.</p>

<p>Indeed I feel that there must be hidden parody in
the earlier writings of Mr Lardner, too, because he is
so clean in handling it now. Satire in detail he had—there
is a dictionary of it in his one word “he-ll.”
Elsewhere, in a series later than <i>You Know Me, Al</i>
he has described a half-fatuous, half-hardheaded
roughneck dragging his silly and scheming wife and
sister-in-law through the hotels and apartments of the
backwash of society, and the story grew more and
more sardonic, more and more entertaining; little of
the aimless, sickly, trivial life of the merely prosperous
escaped him. Unlike Mr Dooley, his chief
concerns were private ones; it is only recently that he
has touched upon public affairs. For a long time his
only “universal” was baseball—a form of entertainment
which now bores him exceedingly. He is also
bored, I gather from an interview in the New York
<i>Globe</i>, with the sort of fiction he has been writing,
and amuses himself with writing plays. But as a
satirist he is turning slowly towards matters of pith,
and the question of his ultimate rank depends on this:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Can he, as he broadens out, retain the swift, destructive,
and tremendously funny turn of phrase, the hard
and resistant mind, the gaiety of spirit which have
made him a humorist? Can he, in short, learn from
Mr Dooley and remain Mr Lardner? For many
reasons I think he can.</p>

<p>Between the busher and these newspaper reports
Mr Lardner has written much; among his ephemera,
even, there are many pages not to be lost. I shall
return to them after drawing a long course with Mr
Dooley as my centre, for it is one of the significant
things about Mr Dooley that you must always keep
him in your eye when you are scanning the horizon
for an American satirist.</p>

<p>Mr Dooley was a satirist of the highest order
and an excellent humorist. The combination is interesting.
Psycho-analysts may determine at a later
date that the reason he wrote in dialect was that he
was afraid to attack the American people directly; I
prefer to believe that the good sense of his creator
(Finley Peter Dunne, to be sure; but one always
thinks of Martin Dooley in his independent existence)
saw that a benevolent humour was the correct
medium for a satire adequate to America. And that
is America’s good fortune. Read the criticism of
American warfare and politics as developed in the
satire of Mr Dooley and compare it with the satire
of French politics and warfare as expressed in the
irony of Anatole France; without measuring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
quality of the one by the other, think only that each
is <i>adequate</i> to the subject. Less than the bitterness
of <i>Penguin Island</i> and the <i>Histoire contemporaine</i>
would not have served for France; more than the
laughter of Dooley would have been disproportionate
and unmanly for us.</p>

<p>Satire is like parody in admitting the integrity of
the subject; it is a pruning knife applied for the good
of the tree; and irony is a dagger with corrosive
poison at the tip. Satire is proper to America because
essentially the satirist believes that life is all right,
and that only the extravagances and frailties of
American life, at the moment of writing, need correction
or are subject to mockery. The Frenchman, in a
highly organized society, which he takes to be not
only the best expression of life, but life itself, turns
to irony as his natural mode when he is confronted
with the ineluctable vision of its evil.</p>

<p>The danger is, to be sure, that our satirists remain
superficial. When the thing is done roughly, without
much humour, with no rich sense of the vastness and
variety of the comic carnival, we get little more than
the eternal “wise crack”; and the wise crack is no
more entertaining in misspelled English than it is in
capital letters, no more in pidgin than in Yiddish.
I do not mean that George Ade and Wallace Irwin
and Bill Nye and Montague Glass haven’t each a
special quality which makes for amusement; I do
mean that they lack the great general qualities of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
knowing and understanding which create humour.
An illustration will do more than any defining to
make the difference clear. The Japanese Schoolboy
used to begin his letters, “To Hon. Editor” and Ring
Lardner is, I suppose, the only man in America who
can begin, “Well, friends....”</p>

<p>Ambrose Bierce is generally supposed to have had
this quality; certainly he had intelligence and wrote
respectable English with a cold pen. His <i>Dictionary</i>
does not impress me as the work of a spirit naturally
ironical. Ade wrote satirically a long time ago; once
in a while something occurs in the <i>Fables</i> to justify
the acclaim of which F. P. A. is the curator. There is
much more in Artemas Ward, whose glory is kept
alive, worthily, by the sardonic leader-writer of <i>The
Freeman</i>, Mr Albert Jay Nock. As language neither
Ade nor Ward approaches in interest the studies of
Mark Twain in <i>Life on the Mississippi</i>, nor those of
Dooley and Lardner. The difference between Bill
Nye and Ward on one side and Montague Glass and
Lardner on the other, is that the former did not use
an actually viable language or dialect, but used distortions
of English for a specific effect. (I am far
from suggesting that Ward did not use American
notably, nor that his language is the better part of his
work; he was a real satirist.) It is my guess that in
the beginning the misspelled words signified that the
speaker was the hard sensible common man with none
of “your” refinements. Juvenal and Johnson may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
have been superior to the thing attacked; it pleased
the democratic American to pretend to be beneath it.
The literary success of the dialects is another matter,
which anyone who believes that ours is still an Anglo-Saxon
country will do well to consider. Montague
Glass is particularly interesting in this respect. He
impresses me as being neither a wise nor a foolish
man, but a smart one. What gave him his vogue was
his conformity with the norm of business acuteness
and his use of a highly complex private racial idiom,
which expresses a highly complex integrated almost
secret racial life; he transferred, almost transliterated
it into recognizable, at least understandable English,
with such a climax as “I wish I were dead, God forbid!”
which was recognized by the populace as a part
of American life ten years before Mr Henry Ford
bought the Protocols. The racial dialect is also exploited,
but not with so reliable an ear, by Hugh
Wiley in his negro stories; it is possible that the
stories of Octavus Roy Cohen are more accurate (they
are not so entertaining); but the life they represent
is, in any case, too near to America to be surprising
to us.</p>

<p>I am convinced that nearly all of Mr Dooley and
nearly all of the later Lardner would stand without
dialect. It is not an odd-looking word that impresses
most in Mr Dooley’s masterpieces about the Dreyfus
case. “The witness will confine himself to forgeries”
is English as Swift would have written it, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
neither better nor worse than, “How th’ divvle can
they perjure thimsilves if they ain’t sworn?” or</p>

<p>“’‘Let us proceed,’ says th’ impartial an’ fair-minded
judge, ‘to th’ thrile iv th’ haynious monsther
Cap Dhry-fuss’ he says. Up jumps Zola, an’ says he
in Frinch: ‘Jackuse,’ he says, which is a hell of a
mane thing to say to anny man. An’ they thrun him
out. ‘Judge’ says th’ attorney f’r th’ difinse, ‘an’ gintlemen
iv’ th’ jury’ he says. ‘Ye’re a liar,’ says th’
judge. ‘Cap, ye’re guilty, an’ ye know it,’ he says....
‘Let us pro-ceed to hearin’ th’ tisti-mony,’ he
says.... Be this time Zola has come back; an’ he
jumps up, an’, says he, ‘Jackuse,’ he says. An’ they
thrun him out.”</p>

<p>It is no wonder that this passage was reprinted
by the New York <i>Evening Post</i> after the expulsion
of the Socialists from Albany. Nearly everything
serious in Dooley has the same relevance, and one
reads about war experts and “disqualifying the
enemy” (in relation to the Spanish-American and
Boer Wars) with a slightly dizzying sensation that
this man has said everything that needed to be said
twenty years in advance of his time. We needed
him badly during the war, but a comic song about him
had somehow withdrawn his name from the rank of
great literature and we had to do with sad second-bests.
There isn’t a chance in the world that he will
be forgotten, because he is recognized in England and
we shall some day reimport his reputation. For he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
has the great advantage of being at the same time a
humorist and a social historian, an every-day philosopher
and the <i>homme moyen sensuel</i>.</p>

<p>His qualities are so immediate that analyzing
them appears superfluous. He gets his effects by distortion,
not by exaggeration. When he told Mr
Roosevelt to call the next edition of his book <i>Alone in
Cubia</i> he extracted an essence from it, rather than inflated
it. His adversatives are surprising and devastating.
He conceives a Blood-is-thicker-than-Water
speech in these terms (from the English to the American):
“Foolish and frivolous people, cheap but thrue-hearted
and insincere cousins.... Ye ar-re savage
but inthrestin’.” Sometimes he leaves out the “but”:
“They was followed be th’ gin’rals iv th’ Fr-rinch
ar-rmy, stalwart, fearless men, with coarse, disagreeable
faces.” His unexpectedness goes farther; he
once said that left alone General Shafter could have
taken “Sandago” without losing an ounce.</p>

<p>I do not wish to write a literary essay about Mr
Dooley, and having mentioned Swift I have little to
say. I must admit that the Irish of Mr Dooley is
stage-Irish; what makes it acceptable is that it is entirely
Dooley-Irish, and whatever the spelling, whatever
the oddities of words, the intonation is always
right. For of course it is possible to write a dialect
without imitation of sound, and to do it effectively
and honestly. Sherwood Anderson has done it in <i>I
Want to Know Why</i> and in <i>I’m a Fool</i>; Lardner has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
done it in <i>The Golden Honeymoon</i>; and the amiable
efforts of Mr John V. A. Weaver are ineffective because
in nine out of ten cases he is setting slang
words, well observed and accurately recorded, to the
rhythm of literary English. Mr Dooley’s rhythm is
always that of the estimable, easy-going barkeeper
who is speaking.</p>

<p>One looks back with a certain envy to the time
when a barkeeper could talk about the world. Our
present social situation is disjected, and the period
before the war seems incredibly calm and halcyon. It
seems to us that then America was settling into the
character it had made for itself in the Civil War, a
time of consolidation and certainty. A minor passion
for social justice seems to have been the only great
force hostile to that sense of security and self-satisfaction
without which no civilization can become sophisticated
and refined. It was pre-eminently the time
when a satirist could exist. Mr Dooley is the proof
that he did. He understood his America, as in his
time, and without bitterness he makes it live again.</p>

<p>Ten years from now, if we settle down, Mr Lardner
may have another such opportunity. For the
moment he is driven to the surface; he has no <i>point
d’appui</i> for his attack; in a bewildering and unsure
civilization, he is himself unsure. It is possible that
he will become so accustomed to shallow waters that
he will never venture into deep; I should be sorry,
because he has qualities too precious to be wasted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
He is developing a strain of wild imagination, of
something approaching fantasy. And his occasional
pieces of fiction are far beyond the average of stories
written in America. <i>The Golden Honeymoon</i> (which
Mr Edward J. O’Brien had the acumen to put in his
collection of the best stories of 1922) is almost a
masterpiece; it has a sort of artistic wisdom, is without
tricks, and is beautifully written. He has also
written a burlesque which failed drearily with the
49-ers and a sketch, <i>The Bull Pen</i>, in which the
busher reappeared, which was a moderate success in
the Ziegfeld Follies. This piece and <i>The Golden
Honeymoon</i> show a fresh tendency on Lardner’s part
to understate; they are actually quiet, as if he were
tired of noisiness. I do not think he is tired of anything.
In an interview recently he said, “Some philosopher
once said that if you want a thing badly
when you’re young you’re likely to get too much of it
before you’re old; <i>I hope to God he knew what he was
talking about</i>.” He is afraid of nothing; one fancies
he doesn’t care for too many things.</p>

<p>He grew weary, a little while ago, of the literary
diaries published from week to week by the highbrows,
these records “of who they seen and talked to
and what they done since the last time we heard from
them” and so he wrote his own for the New York
Sunday <i>American</i>. Among the items chronicled were:</p>

<p>“When I got home Sousa was there and we played
some Brahms and Grieg with me at the piano and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
him at one end of a cornet. ‘How well you play,
Lardy,’ was Sousa’s remark. Brahms called up in the
evening and him and his wife come over and played
rummy....” (This is grotesque, but he knows his
subject.) “Had breakfast with Mayor Hylan and
Senator Lodge.... Went home and played some
Rubinstein on the black keys.... President
Harding called up long distants to say hello. The
Mrs talked to him as I was playing with the cat....
Took a ride on the Long Island R.R. to study
human nature....” And so on. It is a little
better than verbal parody, is it not, Lardy?</p>

<p>Mr Lardner pretends still to feel some of the he-man’s
contempt for letters, suggesting at the same
time the fat-headed pride of a real-estate broker who
has had a patriotic poem printed in the local paper.
He is, as Sherwood Anderson says, “sticking to the
gang.” But he is wise and witty and he has few compunctions
about being vulgar. It is his most precious
asset. For in America the fear of vulgarity is the beginning
of deadness. Abase! (if I may quote Mr
Dooley).</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> incurable romanticist, George Jean Nathan,
was the first to speak boldly in print and establish the
rule of the silver-limbed, implacable Aphrodite in the
theatre of Florenz Ziegfeld; and the equally incurable
realist, Heywood Broun, has discovered that it
isn’t so. Mr Nathan, obsessed by the idea that the
world in general, and America in particular, goes to
any extreme to conceal its interest in sex, really did
a service to humanity by pointing out that there <i>were</i>
beautiful girls in revues and that these girls constituted
one of the main reasons for the attendance of
men at the performances. Mr Broun, sensing a lack
of abandon and frenzy in the modern bacchanale,
says, simply, that it isn’t so, and implies that anyone
who could get a thrill out of that—! Like the king
in that story of Hans Christian Andersen, of which
Mr Broun is inordinately fond, the girls haven’t any
clothes on; and this little child, noticing the fact, is
dreadfully disappointed.</p>

<p>Now Mr Ziegfeld is, in the opinion of those who
work for him, a genius, and can well afford to say,
“A plague on both your houses,” for he has built up
what he himself calls a national institution, glorifying,
not degrading, the American girl (<i>pauvre petite</i>).
He can afford to look with complacency upon
undergraduates charging upon his theatre in the anticipation
of unholy delights, and forced to bear the
clownings of Eddie Cantor or the wise sayings of
Will Rogers; then he can turn to Dr John Roach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
Straton who, having heard from Mr Broun that the
Follies are chaste, approaches to see some monstrosity
of a classic ballet and hears the vast decent sensuality
of a jazz number instead.</p>

<p>Mr Ziegfeld has lived through so much—through
the period when it was believed indecent to be undressed
and through the manlier period when nudity
was contrasted with nakedness (it is the basis of a
sort of Y. M. C. A. æsthetics that the nude is always
pure) and through the long period, 1911–15, when the
reviewers discovered the superior attractiveness of the
stockinged leg; art in the shape of Joseph Urban has
left a permanent mark upon him, and he has trafficked
in strange seas for numbers and devices; what
was vulgar and what was delicate, boresome and
thrilling, have all passed through his hands; he has
sent genius whistling down the wind to the vaudeville
stage and built up new successes with secondary
material; the storehouses are littered with the gaudy
monuments of his imitators. And all the time the
secret of his success has been staring Broadway in the
face.</p>

<p>It is well to speak of Mr Ziegfeld’s success because
in the last few years several things have happened
to the revue; for almost as long as I remember
the Ziegfeld Follies, I remember the Winter Garden
opposition, the Passing Show, its exact antithesis.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
But lately there have arrived at least two productions
which give every guaranty of permanence, in addition
to some others which may turn out to be equally sure
of survival. I mean the Music Box Revue and the
Greenwich Village Follies. The Music Box is only
in its third year; its chiefs assets are one of the most
agreeable theatres in New York, assuring a reputation
on the road, and first call on the still unsatisfied
talents of Mr Irving Berlin. The Greenwich Village
Follies, even if it lose its present director, John
Murray Anderson, will continue to be successful for
one of the strangest reasons in the world—its reputation
for being “artistic.” The Winter Garden, the
two Follies, and the Music Box, are the four points
of the compass in this truly magnetic field. When
the needle points due north, I usually find Mr Ziegfeld
fairly snug under the Pole Star.</p>

<p>There are, if you count the chorus individually,
about a hundred reasons for seeing a revue; there is
only one reason for thinking about it, and that is that
at one point, and only one point, the revue touches
upon art. The revue as a production manifests the
same impatience with half measures, with boggling,
with the good enough and the nearly successful, which
every great artist feels, or pretends to feel, in regard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
to his own work. It shows a mania for perfection; it
aspires to be precise and definite, it corresponds to
those <i>de luxe</i> railway trains which are always exactly
on time, to the millions of spare parts that always fit,
to the ease of commerce when there is a fixed price;
jazz or symphony may sound from the orchestra pit,
but underneath is the real tone of the revue, the
steady, incorruptible purr of the dynamo. And with
the possible exception of architecture, <i>via</i> the back
door of construction, the revue is the most notable
place in which this great American dislike of bungling,
the real pleasure in a thing perfectly done,
apply even vaguely to the arts.</p>

<p>If you can bring into focus, simultaneously, a
good revue and a production of grand opera at the
Metropolitan Opera House, the superiority of the
lesser art is striking. Like the revue, grand opera is
composed of elements drawn from many sources; like
the revue, success depends on the fusion of these elements
into a new unit, through the highest skill in
production. And this sort of perfection the Metropolitan
not only never achieves—it is actually absolved
in advance from the necessity of attempting it.
I am aware that it has the highest-paid singers, the
best orchestra, some of the best conductors, dancers
and stage hands, and the worst scenery in the world,
in addition to an exceptionally astute impresario;
but the production of these elements is so haphazard
and clumsy that if any revue-producer hit as low a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
level in his work, he would be stoned off Broadway.
Yet the Metropolitan is considered a great institution
and complacently permitted to run at a loss, because
its material is <span class="smcap">Art</span>.</p>

  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">The Sun’s Dwelling.</span> By Joseph Urban</div></div>

<p>The same thing is true in other fields—in producing
serious plays, in writing great novels, we will
stand for a second-rateness we would not for a moment
abide in the construction of a bridge or the making
of an omelette, or the production of a revue. And
because in a revue the bunk doesn’t carry, the revue
is one of the few places you can go with the assurance
that the thing, however tawdry in itself, will be
well done. If it is tawdry, it is so in keeping with the
taste of its patrons, and without pretense; whereas in
the major arts—no matter how magnificent the masquerade
of Art may be—the taste of a production is
usually several notches below the taste of the patrons.</p>

<p>The good revue pleases the eye, the ear, and the
pulse; the very good revue does this <i>so well that it
pleases the mind</i>. It operates in that equivocal zone
where a thing does not have to be funny—it need
only sound funny; nor be beautiful if it can for a
fleeting moment appear beautiful. It does not have
to send them away laughing or even whistling; all
it needs to do is to keep the perceptions of the audience
fully engaged all the time, and the evaporation
of its pleasures will bring the audience back
again and again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>The secret I have alluded to is how to create
the atmosphere of seeming—and Mr Ziegfeld knows
the secret in every detail. In brief, he makes everything
appear perfect by a consummate smoothness
of production. Undoubtedly ten or fifteen other people
help in this—I use Mr Ziegfeld’s name because
in the end he is responsible for the kind of show put
out in his name and because the smoothness I refer
to goes far beyond the mechanism of the stage or skill
in directing a chorus. It is not the smoothness of
a connecting rod running in oil, but of a batter where
all the ingredients are so promptly introduced and so
thoroughly integrated that in the end a man may
stand up and say, This is a Show. Everyone with
a grain of sense knows that Mr Urban can make all
the sets for a production and Mr Berlin write all
the music; Mr Ziegfeld has the added grain to see
that if he’s going to have a great variety of things and
people, he had better divide his <i>décor</i> and his music
among many different talents.</p>

<p>There have been funnier revues and revues more
pleasing to the eye and revues with far better popular
music; nowhere have all the necessary ingredients
appeared to such a high average of advantage.
Mr Anderson could barely keep Bert Savoy within the
bounds of a revue; the Music Box collapses entirely
as a revue at a few dance steps by Bobby Clark.
But Ziegfeld as early as 1910 was able to throw together
Harry Watson (Young Kid Battling Dugan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
nowadays, in vaudeville), Fannie Brice, Anna Held,
Bert Williams, and Lillian Lorraine and, as if to
prove that he was none the less producing a revue,
bring down his curtain on a set-piece of “Our American
Colleges.” And twelve years later, with Will
Rogers and Gilda Grey and Victor Herbert and Ring
Lardner, he is still producing a revue and brings
both curtains down on his chorus—once <i>en masse</i>
and the second time undressing for the street in silhouette.</p>

<p>I cannot estimate the amount of satisfaction which
since those early days Mr Ziegfeld has provided.
My own memories do not go back to the actual productions
in which Anna Held figured; I recall only
the virtuous indignation of elderly people and my
own mixed feelings of curiosity and disgust when I
overheard reports of the goings-on. But from the
time I begin to remember them until to-day there has
always been a peculiar quality of pleasure in the
Ziegfeld shows, and the uninterrupted supply of
things pleasant to see and entertaining to hear, has
been admirable. Mr Ziegfeld has never been actually
courageous; his novelties are never more audacious
than, say, radiolite costumes or an Urban backdrop.
He is apparently pledged to the tedious set-pieces
which are supposed to be artistic—the Ben Ali Haggin
effects, the Fan in Many Lands or the ballot of A
Night in Statuary Hall with the discobolus coming
to life and the arms of the Venus de Milo miraculously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
restored. There are years, too, in which Mr
Ziegfeld, discovering new talent, follows but one vein
and leaves his shows so much in one tone that a slight
depression sets in. Mr Edmund Wilson, in the
<i>Dial</i> repeats the plaint of Mr Heywood Broun in the
<i>World</i>—that the Follies are frigid—the girls are all
straight, the ballet becomes a drill, the very laughs
are organized and mechanical. Well, it happens to
be the function of the Ziegfeld Follies to be Apollonic,
not Dionysian; the leap and the cry of the bacchanale
give way to the song and dance, and when
we want the true frenzy we have to go elsewhere.
I doubt whether even the success of the negro shows
will frighten Ziegfeld into mingling with his other
elements some that will be riotous and wild; the
best they can do will be to prevent Ziegfeld from
growing too utterly “refined.” He tends at this moment
to quiet fun of the Lardner type and the occasional
horseplay with which he accentuates this murmur,
this smile, is usually unsuccessful. I am, myself,
more moved by broader strokes than his, but I
recognize that Ziegfeld, and not the producers of
<i>Shuffle Along</i>, is in the main current of our development—that
we tend to a mechanically perfect society
in which we will either master the machine or
be enslaved by it. And the only way to master it—since
we cannot escape—will be by understanding it
in every detail. That is exactly Mr Ziegfeld’s present
preoccupation. I dissent, however, from the suggestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
that the physical loveliness of the Ziegfeld
chorus has ceased to be seductive. Some, as Mr Lardner
once said—some like ’em cold, and there are at
least five other choruses which affect me as pleasurably.
But for those that like the Ziegfeld-type
chorus, which has always a deal of stateliness and a
haughty air of being damned well bred, Mr Ziegfeld’s
production of the wares is perfect. He has simply
moved his chorus one step backward in order to make
them appear slightly inaccessible and so a little more
desirable. His attack is indirect, but it is no less
certain.</p>

<p>In the back of the mind there always remains the
idea that a revue ought to be a revue of something,
and as far as I know, George M. Cohan is the last
of those who have tried to accomplish that. Weber
and Fields presented burlesque; Mr Cohan’s efforts
are not lost in that dim perspective, and they
seem superior, for he wove his amazingly expert parodies
of current successes into a new creation, a veritable
review. The high spirits and sophistication
of the Cohan revues have not frequently been
equalled on our stage, for the whole of Cohan’s talents
were poured into them without reserve. The
parodies and satire were merciless and spared not
even himself; for he took the old jibe about his
Yankee-Doodleism and wrote apropos of a show of
his which had failed: “Go, get a Flag, For you need
it, you need it, you know you need it!” He took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
off <i>Common Clay</i> in swift and expert patter; he
destroyed the “song hit” with <i>Down by the Erie</i> ten
years earlier and ten times better than the Forty-niners
did; he advertised himself and ridiculed his
own self-advertisement; he was the principal actor
and he played fair with Willie Collier and Charles
Winninger and Louise Dresser. Throughout he was
the high point of Cohanism, of that shrewd, cock-sure,
arrogant, wise, and witty man who was the true
expression of the America of Remember the Maine!,
the McKinley elections, the Yellow Kid, and <i>Coon!
Coon! Coon!</i> He was always smart, always versatile.
To this day he is smart enough to produce <i>Mary</i>
and <i>Little Nelly Kelly</i>, knowing that the old stuff
goes biggest and that even in the midst of his own sophistication
he can capture vaster audiences with his
own simplicity. This is an abdication of his proper
function, to be sure. The man who had so much to
do with the great-American-drama (I allude to <i>Seven
Keys to Baldpate</i> and the description “great-American”
is deliberate) and who could take any trash (<i>A
Prince There Was</i>) and make it go, through the indefatigable
energy and the cleverness of his own acting,
and who could fight the world with his preposterous
<i>Tavern</i>—this man had no right to give up
doing what he did so well. I care nothing for the
famous nasalities of George M. Cohan; after the
Four Cohans I saw him first as actor, so I do not
mourn for his dancing days. But I know that with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
only a fraction of Berlin’s gifts as a composer, he had
something which even Berlin lacks: the complete
sense of the boards. His revues would have been
desirable additions to each theatrical season if they
had done no more than produce himself. His hard
sense, his unimaginative but not unsympathetic response
to everything that took place on the street and
at the bar and on the stage made him a prince of
reviewers—he was not without malice and he was
wholly without philosophy. Perhaps that is why his
revues were wonderfully gay. Why they ever
stopped I cannot tell; when they stopped, strangely
enough, they left the field to the Winter Garden.
I make no claim that the revues at this house are
always pleasing; people apparently still exist who
are enthusiasts for Valeska Surratt. But I do claim
that they are always revues, even if they are sometimes
to be weighed by avoirdupois and not by critical
standard.</p>

  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">George M. Cohan.</span> By Alfred Frueh
</div></div>

<p>The annihilation of all the vast and silly posturing
which went on a few years ago under the name
of <i>The Jest</i> was accomplished in a perfect burlesque
by Blanche Ring and Charles Winninger (the latter
played Leo Ditrichstein in one of the Cohan revues)
and if <i>The Sheik</i> never reached the stage it is possibly
because Eddie Cantor burlesqued it in advance
on a bicycle and with a time clock for the women of
the harem. What has held the Winter Garden down
(except, of course, when Al Jolson there inhabited)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
is the lack of good music; for the humour has always
been broad and the slap-stick merry. The shows
there always seem to be hankering a little for the
additional vulgarity of out-and-out burlesque, but the
Rath Brothers were as much at home there as the
Avon Comedy Four; if my head were at stake I
could not recall a single thing there which could be
called exquisite, but I swear that as the show girls
shuffled precariously up and down the runway I
did at times fancy I heard the stamping of a goatish
foot behind the scenes, and if I didn’t like the sound,
I was in the minority. The Winter Garden has always
been, in part, a direct assault on the senses and
the method of art is always indirect; Mr Ziegfeld
knows this and always manages to bathe his scenes
in a cool virginal light, to the intensification of
pleasure for the connoisseurs.</p>

<p>The difference between these two shows can be
measured by watching one figure pass across the
stage of each. Last year at the Winter Garden Conchita
Piquer sang a <i>malagueña</i>. (You can discover
all you need to know about the <i>malagueña</i> in
Mr Santayana’s Soliloquies; to us it is the perfect
exotic, as strange to our ears as Chinese song—stranger
because it remains recognizably Occidental,
yet seems to be based on no intervals known to our
scales, and its rhythm is capricious and uncertain).
She sang it “wildly well,” with a pert assured air
of superiority. Yet she cast flowers into the audience<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
as she did so, and the background and the massing
of the chorus behind her were all out of key and
prevented the song from being what at the Ziegfeld
Follies it inevitably must have been, exquisite.</p>

<p>At the Follies passes Gilda Grey, a performer
of limited talents gifted with unutterable intensity.
Against a flaring background in which all the signs
of all of Broadway are crowded together, she sings a
commentary on the negro invasion—<i>It’s Getting Very
Dark on Old Broadway</i>—the scene fades and radiolite
picks out the white dresses of the chorus, the
hands and faces recede into undistinguishable black.
And while the chorus sings Miss Grey’s voice rises in
a deep and shuddering ecstasy to cry out the two
words, “Getting darker!” To disengage that cry, to
insure its repercussion, went all the skill of production
in everything that preceded and in everything
that followed. It was exciting, but it was also exquisite,
and that is exactly what the Winter Garden
could not have done.</p>

<p>Neither of the two Music Box revues has reached
that height, because in neither has production kept
pace with Berlin’s music. It is part of the technique
of the revue to have “stunts” and Berlin, being <i>capable
du tout</i>, last year set a dining menu to music.
Yet nothing was added when lobster and mayonnaise
and celery appeared in the flesh; even worse,
this year something precious is lost when one of Berlin’s
veritable masterpieces, <i>Pack Up Your Sins and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Go to the Devil</i>, is produced with an endless number
of trapdoors and hoists and all the other mechanics
of the stage. The first of the two revues flourished
on humour—Willie Collier and Sam Bernard were inexpressibly
funny—and on Berlin’s <i>Say It With Music</i>;
so long as it stayed in New York the appearance
in person of Mr Berlin, explaining to the well-remembered
tunes how he wrote each of his masterpieces
of ragtime, added much.</p>

<p>The tone of this revue was the tone of the
building itself—varying from the cool and well-proportioned
exterior to the comfortable, a little
lavish interior. Florence Moore was as outrageous
as ever, and at least as active; she is the most tireless
person on the stage and to me the most tiring,
for her vitality affects me as a cyclone in which I am
quite unnecessarily involved. All the more surprising,
then, was her shift from horseplay to burlesque
in the house-hunting scene with Sam Bernard, at the
end of which the children were shot by their despairing
parents to remove the one obstacle between them
and the perfect apartment. In an earlier scene
Collier had had his chance—the one in which Bernard
tried to explain his difficulties and to read a
letter. All of Bernard’s stutterings and flounderings
in the English vocabulary availed nothing against
Collier’s imperturbable indifference. Collier has always
had a divine spark—it was visible even in <i>The
Hottentot</i>—and in that scene it glowed beautifully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
The show was, to be sure, held in the matrix of Berlin’s
score, and was as much held <i>down</i> as up to that
level—I mean it was not spoiled by the intrusion of
alien theatrical elements. Since then a new hydraulic
system has apparently been added to the equipment
of the stage, and Hassard Short, confusing the dynamics
of the theatre with mere hoisting power, moves
everything that can be moved except the audience.
The elements are all there, but they are produced as
if it were a benefit, not a revue.</p>

<p>John Murray Anderson’s is the hardest case to be
sure about. A year ago he “struck a new note in revues”—by
producing one without a scintilla of interest
in any of its proceedings. Nothing quite so
lackadaisical and dull has ever had such a success.
Yet he had long before established a repute for being
artistic—and, as far as I can judge, it was by the
exploitation of millions of yards of draperies in place
of the usual canvas scenery. It was a sound notion,
and in the first of these productions, <i>What’s in a
Name?</i> there was a pretty air of the semi-professional,
a challenging suggestion of improvisation, as if the
chorus and principals weren’t sure from moment to
moment what the <i>régisseur</i> might suggest for them to
do next.</p>

<p>He has always presented some of the loveliest
and some of the ugliest costumes in New York; and
now that draperies are no longer his only resource,
he falls back upon transformations in scenery, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
makes a painted backdrop of the Moonlight Sonata
come to life, with music, to the astonishment of the
multitude.</p>

<p>In short, it would appear that Mr Anderson is introducing
into the revue precisely that element of
artistic bunk which has long been the property of the
bogus arts. I resent it, and resent it the more because
he doesn’t need it. In his recent show there
were elements beyond words to praise; the singing of
Yvonne George was superb and superbly arranged;
the Widow Brown song, sung and <i>danced</i> by Bert
Savoy, had a quality of tenderness which all the sentimental
songs in the Ziegfeld Follies try vainly to
transmit; the two little tumblers, Fortunello and
Cirillino, are by name and manner of the <i>commedia
dell’arte</i> and John Hazzard’s song about Alaska, with
slides by Walter Hoban, is the stuff that Forty-niners
are made of.</p>

<p>It was in this show that the Herriman-Carpenter
ballet of Krazy Kat was tried and dismissed, and the
fault here is the fault of Mr Anderson throughout.
Again it was attempted with an artistic dancer, when
everyone who has intelligence of Krazy knows that
it should be done by an American stunt dancer until
the time when Mr Chaplin finds time to do it. Krazy
Kat is exquisite and funny—and whether Mr Carpenter
lets him remain so or not, it is clear that Mr
Anderson wanted him to be artistic at all cost. So
with his whole production; he has sacrificed fun all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
the way down the line; one is pleased, much more
than amused, and the gigantic revelry, the broad levity
of Bert Savoy stand apart from the show like a
stranger. It is the one revue in which the mass
dancing entirely fails to remain in the memory, and
I am convinced that if Miss Brice hadn’t, in the
Ziegfeld Follies, made <i>Mon Homme</i> a popular hit,
Miss George’s far more fiery and varied and more
generally interesting rendition of it would leave it
cold in the ears of the audiences. For Mr Anderson
has so far learned only to put over separate things,
and until you put the whole thing over the individual
things gain but half their victories.</p>

<p>That completes the circle to Mr Ziegfeld, and,
since it is a question of putting it over, associates
with him another man who on at least one occasion
has done as well, Mr Charles Dillingham. If you
omit the one man shows as practised by Ed Wynn,
Frank Tinney and Al Jolson, and the nondescripts
of Hitchcock, and pass over <i>Stop! Look! Listen!</i> as
varying too far from the revue type, there remains
<i>Watch Your Step</i> as another high spot in production,
with the dancing of the Castles, the humours of that
very great comedian, Harry Kelly, and of Tinney,
the scenery and costumes by Robert McQuinn and
Helen Dryden, and the whole story of contemporary
dancing in Mr Berlin’s music. Except for Harry
Kelly, every item was bettered in <i>Stop! Look! Listen!</i>,
but in spite of the presence of Gaby Deslys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
it was not a revue—whereas <i>Watch Your Step</i> almost
consciously set out to proclaim itself superior in fineness
and slickness to the Follies and almost succeeded.</p>

<p>I am trying to sketch the main <i>types</i> of revue,
not to write a history of the revue; it is to be hoped
that some one sufficiently sentimental can be found
to do the job. Whether in a history the drunken
scene of Leon Errol in the subway would figure largely,
I do not know; I am not even sure that the scene in
the Grand Central while it was building, with Bert
Williams as the porter, would be noted; quite possibly
the memory of Lillian Lorraine on the swings—to
me merely a bearable necessity—and Frank Carter
singing, (1918) <i>I’m Going to Pin My Medal on the
Girl I Left Behind</i>, will seem more important than
Ina Claire’s mimicry of Frances Starr’s <i>Marie-Odile</i>.
It is possible that the injection of real humour, like
Lardner’s, may make the set scenes like Laceland or
the History of Shoes through the Ages or Our Colleges
more and more dispensable. I do not know.
I feel fairly certain only of this: that the relative importance
of the workers in the field is measured by
their mastery of the art of production far more than
by their skill in picking individuals and stunts. I
am also convinced that those who have arrived at
this perfection in an effort to give America pleasure
have done more for us than those who haven’t got
half way in trying to give us art.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Anyone</span> so minded can write an entirely false
history of American civilization by setting down
in parallel columns the vogues and rages which have
overtaken us and Europe at the same time. The
highly patriotic, but a bit undergraduate, habit of
slanging your own country is always more effective
if the facts about any other country are a little obscure,
and, thanks to the cable and the efficacy of
transatlantic mails, we now know virtually everything
that isn’t so, and virtually nothing that is important,
about Europe. So it is quite possible for
a critic to say that in literature the taste of Europe
is far beyond ours, on the ground that Harold Bell
Wright is the typical American author and Conrad
and Anatole France and Tolstoi the typical European.
I mean that this is possible if a critic has
never heard of the work of Nat Gould and William
Le Queux in England, for instance.</p>

<p>The latest of these false parallels would be this:
that while Europe was going in for the primitive
sculpture of the African negro, America devoted itself
and its theatres to musical shows composed and
produced by the nonprimitive negroes of Harlem,
New York.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The wail of the saxophone in <i>Shuffle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Along</i> had not yet died in my ears when a Serious
Critic made moan in his journal that the authors of
that piece were truckling to the white man’s sense of
superiority by exhibiting their own flesh and blood as
a pack of cheats and scoundrels. What had impressed
me as a fairly awkward mechanism for introducing
songs and dances was by him taken as a
libel on a race; and forgetting the picaresque romance
from the <i>Odyssey</i> to <i>Get-Rich-Quick-Wallingford</i>,
forgetting that all peoples seem to take an abundant
pleasure in exposing themselves as delightful rogues,
he wept over this degradation. At about that time Mr
Clive Bell, marking a reaction from the extreme
vogue of African plastic, still ranked the sculptures
produced by savage and semicivilized negroes as
only a little below those of the two or three great
periods of artistic production. Again it would seem
that Europe had, in its effete way, stolen a march
on us.</p>

<p>In effect the coloured shows were entertaining and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
interesting to think about, whether they were good or
bad, and most of them were pretty bad. As shows,
that is. As shows in a country which really knows
how to produce soul-satisfying eye-and-ear entertainment.
They had certain attractive qualities, and if
they were in essence second rate, they were at
least dynamic, while the first-rate thing in Europe
was static. While Europe remained calm after
the war we, hysterically, went in for an enormous
increase of pace in the active arts of the theatre.
I do not know whether we are altogether the
losers, and leave the question to others. I do know
that for a moment these pieces seem to have overshadowed
our (can I say?) native revues.</p>

<p>Of course, in America no one cares for revues except
the unenlightened millions who pay to see them,
so there is no one to rise and make lamentation over
this state of affairs. For years we have laboured to
perfect our revues—and the shuffling feet of a barbarian
summon up an evil djinn to banish them.
The serene smoothness of manœuvre which Mr Wayburn
prepares for Mr Ziegfeld shrinks from the
boards before the haphazard leaping of unstudied
numbers; the sweet gravity of the dancers is forgotten
for the barbarous rhythm of any half dozen darkies
with a sense of syncopation innate in them. Lavishness
from Joseph Urban precariously maintains itself
against the smudged backdrop and the overall;
and over the prostrate and flowerlike and seductive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
beauty of the chorus-girl, there steps and struts, magnificently
struts, the high-yaller!</p>

<p>The comparatively sober truth is that the negro
cabaret in the theatre is only a diversion, a necessary
and healthful variation from our norm. It has qualities
seldom exquisite and always arresting; and these
qualities, having slowly vanished from the revue,
have found themselves again in burlesque and in
these exotics. And I think it highly probable that
their only lasting effect will be to restore certain
highly desirable things to revue and musical comedy.
If there is any doubt of their goodness, another contrast
will prove the point.</p>

<p>The one claim never made for the negro shows is
that they are artistic. Set beside them, then, a professedly
artistic revue, the <i>Pinwheel</i>, compounded of
native and exotic effects. It had two or three interesting
or exciting numbers; but the whole effect was
one of dreariness. The pall of art was upon it; it
died nightly. And <i>Shuffle Along</i>, without art, but
with tremendous vitality, not only lived through the
night, but dragged provincial New Yorkers to a midnight
show as well. Facing the other way, one beholds
a straight fake, the untimely efforts of Messrs
McIntyre and Heath, who served only to remind us
that in time since overpast the real nigger show, as
practised by Williams and Walker, existed, and that
what we are seeing now is actually a continuation
thereof, brought down from Harlem to Broadway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>Now it was fairly obvious that <i>Shuffle Along</i>
had been conceived as an entertainment for negroes;
that is why it remained solid when it took Broadway,
to the intense surprise of its producers. It was, in
short, an exotic for us, but it wasn’t an exotic for
themselves. Its honesty was its success, and its honesty
put a certain stamp upon its successors. In all
of them there is visible a regrettable tendency to imitate,
at moments, the worst features of our usual musical
comedy. But the major portion of each show is
native, and so good.</p>

<p>They have all of them an appearance of unpremeditated
violence which distinguishes them from
the calculated and beautiful effects of Mr Ziegfeld
or Mr John Murray Anderson. It goes much beyond
the celebrated (and by this time faked) appearance
of “enjoying themselves.” They may never
forgive me for it, but I really do not care whether
the actors and actresses who amuse me are having a
good time themselves. The theatre, for them, is a
place for <i>producing</i>, not for <i>enjoying</i> sensations and
effects; so the one thing I wish them is that when they
are good they may have the purely moral pleasure
of being good. It is the method that counts, and in
the negro shows the method has been always the maximum
pressure in song and dance, and the minimum
of subtlety in the conversations and patter songs.
The exceptions are not notable.</p>

<p>The songs and dances must be scored <i>fff</i>, a <i>stretto</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
and after that those diverging lines which indicate
<i>crescendo</i>; the lines of violence never again approach
each other in these numbers, and one has to wait for
the appearance of a fairly silly sentimental song for
a moment of quiet. The strange people who direct
these shows and the responsive animals who sing and
dance have with some success controverted the notion
that it is in contrasts that the intelligent man has
his greatest pleasure. One feels that the show is a
continuous wild cry and an uninterrupted joyous
rage, that the <i>élan vital</i> is inexhaustible and unbridled
and enormously good.</p>

<p>The most skilful individual player has been Florence
Mills; merely to watch her walk out upon the
stage, with her long, free stride and her superb, shameless
swing, is an æsthetic pleasure; she is a school and
exemplar of carriage and deportment; two other actors
I have seen so take a stage; Cohan by stage instinct,
Marie Tempest by a cultivated genius. Florence
Mills is almost the definition of the romantic
“<i>une force qui va</i>,” but she remains an original, with
little or nothing to give beyond her presence, her instinctive
grace, and her baffling, seductive voice.
Without that endowment, a small one in comparison
with, say, Gilda Grey’s, almost all the others give
nothing but energy, and the trouble there is that if
you have nothing but energy to give, you must give
more than you can afford. The wild cry is a little too
piercing at times, the postures and the pattings and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the leapings all a little beyond the necessary measure.
It remains simple; but simplicity, even if it isn’t
usually vulgar, can be a bit rough.</p>

<p>In the past few years the line of development
of most of our revues and musical shows has been
clearly marked; the bad old days were slowly forgotten
and whatever was suggestive had to become
subtle; and gradually, as the surface polish grew
brighter, the suggestive humours underneath were
forgotten; our revues became denatured in more
senses than one. There is one <i>risqué</i> moment in the
whole of a recent <i>Follies</i>, and that is one more than
usual. The twittering about love and a kiss goes on;
but the Great Reality of Sex is (quite properly, I am
sure) forgotten. And in an encore stanza of <i>He May
Be Your Man, But He Comes to See Me—Sometimes</i>,
as sung at the Plantation, the whole conventionalized
fabric of our popular love songs was
flung aside and the gay reality exposed. This amorous
frankness is part of a simple realism—a sophisticated
realism couldn’t occur in a musical show, unless
in the manner of Offenbach’s <i>La Belle Hélène</i>.
It is a fitting counterpart to the exaggerated postures,
the slightly lubricious gestures and movements, of the
dance. Another simplicity, and a very good one, is
in such a song as that about a dog from Tennessee in
<i>Oh, Joy</i>—a song which with that one quality, and
against indifferent music and unexceptional words,
broke up the show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>Behind the frankness and the violence and the
simplicity there is found the most important factor
of all—the music. And behind that stands a figure
exceedingly attractive and, in its tragedy, almost
moving, that of the late Jim Europe. Of the music
itself—of jazz and the use of spirituals and the whole
question of our national music—this is clearly not
the place to write. One wishes to mention a name or
two: Shelton Brooks, least <i>habile</i> of pseudo-Balieffs,
wrote long ago <i>The Darktown Strutters’ Ball</i>, which
ought not to be forgotten; Creamer and Layton composed
all of <i>Strut, Miss Lizzie</i>, and therein appeared
<i>Sweet Angeline</i>, as complex a piece of syncopation
as Mr Berlin ever composed. What portion of <i>Shuffle
Along</i> was composed by Noble Sissle and Eubie
Blake I do not know, but Sissle in action and Blake
at the piano were wholly satisfying and expert. And
all of these composers, and all of the jazz bands who
play for them, have the ineffable advantage of being
assured, in advance, of dancers who in fancy or
straight dancing have the essential feelings for
rhythm and broken rhythm in their bones.</p>

<p>And that interior response to syncopation Jim Europe
had to the highest possible degree. He had been,
before the war, the band leader at the Castles’; I am
told by one who knows of such matters that his
actual vogue was passing when the war came. He returned
with the 369th U. S. Infantry “Hell-Fighters”
Band and for a few Sunday nights in March,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
1919, he packed the old Manhattan Opera House to
the doors.</p>

<p>Say that what he played had nothing to do with
music; say that to mention the name of a conductor
in the same breath with his name is an atrocity of
taste—I cannot help believing that Jim Europe had
the essential quality of music in him, and that, in his
field, however far from any other it may have been,
he was as great as Karl Muck in his. He did have
contrast; it was out of the contracting stresses of a
regular beat and a divergent that he created his effects.
The hand kept perfect time, and his right
knee, with a sharp and subtle little motion, stressed
the acceleration or retard of the syncope. His dynamics
were beautiful because he knew the value of
noise and knew how to produce it and how to make
it effective; he knew how to keep perfectly a running
commentary of wit over the masses of his sound; and
the ease and smoothness of his own performance as
conductor had all the qualities of greatness. He rebuked
a drummer in his band for some infraction of
discipline and was killed.</p>

<p>Whatever the negro show has to give to the perfected
Broadway production has its sources fairly
deep in the negro consciousness, and I put Jim Europe
forth as its symbol because in him nearly all
that is most precious came to the surface. He seemed
sensitive to the ecstasy and pathos of the spirituals
as he was to the ecstasy and joy of jazz. He was,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
as conductor, vigorous and unaffected and clean. In
<i>Shuffle Along</i>, Messrs Sissle and Blake paid honour
to his memory, but the unacknowledged debt of the
others is greater. I am inclined to think that, if sterility
does not set in for the more notable Broadway
product, it will be because something of what Jim
Europe had to give has been quintessentialized by his
successors and adopted.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">I am</span> going to establish a lyric theatre in America.
Not an art theatre and not a temple of the
drama, and not an experimental theatre. A lyric
theatre where there will always be Mozart and Jerome
Kern and Gilbert-and-Sullivan and Lehar—and
<span class="allsmcap">NEVER</span> by any chance Puccini or the Ring or Ibsen.
I shall avoid the good things and the bad alike in
the serious forms; I shall have Russian Ballets and
American ballets. The chief thing is that it will be a
theatre devoted to <i>all</i> the forms of light musical entertainment
and to nothing else. My theatre will put
an end to those disheartening revivals (or resurrections)
of popular musical shows because the shows
will be kept alive, just as “grand” operas are kept
alive by appearing in a repertory. Into the repertory
I shall incorporate—as soon as their independent
existence is at an end—such successes as <i>The Night
Boat</i> and such failures as <i>The Land of Joy</i>. There
will never be a chance for <i>fashion</i> to destroy things
essentially good. I shall produce new pieces, too;
and if they are good they will run along with frequent
presentations until they are absorbed in the general
scheme. And I think I shall have pastiches frequently—of
revues and topical productions which
aren’t, as entireties, capable of continuing.</p>

<p>That is the abridgement of a scheme, and I say I
shall do it in the hope that someone else, even if it
be the Messrs Shubert, will do it instead. Because
I like musical comedy and it annoys me that I can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
hear <i>Un bel di</i> (which I want never to hear again)
fifteen times a season, and cannot hear <i>The Sun Shines
Brighter</i> or <i>The Ragtime Melodrama</i> ever again.
And I know that our present type of musical comedy
is so good, so vigorous and snappy, that it tends to
kill off its predecessors; a repertory is the only
thing; and the usual objections to repertory will fail
here, because in this case the devotees of musical
shows will know in advance that “it is going to be a
good show.” I don’t know whether the bill should
change every day or every week; I feel certain that
there ought to be half a dozen centres across the continent,
and two or three touring companies. Further
details I cannot give now. I shall try to find some
means, however, of distinguishing between the second-act
finale of <i>The Mottled Mask</i> (“On to the ball
at the palace of Prince Gregory”) from the second-act
finale of <i>The Madcap in Motley</i> (“On to the ball at
the palace of Prince Gregory”). It is not part of my
scheme to keep bad shows alive.</p>

<p>The rare entertainment such a theatre will afford
can be guessed if you look for a moment at the
changes in musical shows since 1900. We were then
coming out of the Gilbert and Sullivan tradition
and (after a great vogue of extravaganza) coming
into the Viennese mode. It is the fashion now, especially
in France, to belittle the Viennese operetta, to
call its waltz song heavy and its structure a bore.
Possibly these things are true; but Vienna has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the home of operetta for over a century and has done
well by itself most of the time. Illumination of this
predominant influence you can get by going to the
Redoutensaal and hearing a performance of <i>The Marriage
of Figaro</i>, and within the next few days hearing
<i>Die Fledermaus</i> and whatever new piece Lehar or
Fall or Oscar Straus has composed. For what one
seldom knows from its loftier production is that
<i>Figaro</i> is in essence and detail a musical comedy and
that almost all we know of the form stems from the
combination effected there by a great composer, a fine
dramatist, and an exceptionally skilful librettist.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
The imperial ballroom with its tapestried walls, its
small stage on which only conventionalized scenery
can be set, its divided stairway coming down on the
stage, is a setting admirably contrived to give the
whole loveliness of operetta. The last scene is in the
garden of the count: six boxed trees and moonlight
create the effect. And at the last moment, the happy
ending, the electric lights are thrown on, the vast
crystal chandelier lighting up over the garden, and
the event recedes into its real, its secondary framework,
as entertainment. One recognizes it for what
it is—the gay and exquisite counterpart of grand
opera, from which neither the Savoy nor the Viennese
operetta ever departed. Musically the Viennese type
corresponds more clearly to Italian, the Gilbert and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Sullivan to French opera. The absurd conventions
of production are taken bodily from the older and
more respected type. The same thing is as obviously
true in Cimarosa’s <i>Marriage Secret</i> as it is in <i>The
Chocolate Soldier</i>—the latter being, except for a
weaker libretto, a perfect parallel to <i>Figaro</i>. (And
nearly as worthy of the perpetual life which is apparently
to be denied it.)</p>

<p>It is still unnecessary to describe the Viennese operetta
in detail, for immediately after the war it
came again into vogue and one or two excellent examples—<i>The
Last Waltz</i> was one of them—re-established
some of its ancient prestige. It is at bottom
produced <i>for the music</i>. In one the music may be
chiefly sung, in another danced. Everything else—<i>décor</i>,
story, humorous episodes—is secondary. Recently
an effort has been made to change this. Oscar
Straus’ <i>Törichte Jungfrau</i> at the Grossesschauspielhaus
(Reinhardt’s catacombs in Berlin) was all production—and
nearly all dreadful. Lehar’s latest, <i>Das
Gelbe Jacke</i> (not, however, our <i>Yellow Jacket</i>) is entirely
in the pure Viennese mode, and the Vienna production
(February, 1923) indicates how Viennese
operetta is improved in transit to our shores. For
our production of musical comedy is almost equal to
our production of revue, which is incontestably the
finest in the world. With their emphasis on music
the Viennese shows naturally centre about the famous
waltz-song; and one good waltz has been able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
to make a show a success. Rudolf Friml made a success
of <i>High Jinks</i> with a fox-trot.</p>

<p>The English type as we know it, including Caryll
and Monckton and Rubens, has had for thirty years
the Savoy tradition. This requires a plot of more
frivolity than the Viennese, and lyrics of greater humour.
The successes have been moderate—“I’ve got
a motto” is no masterpiece. The degree of fun has
been higher and the seductiveness of the music less.
It was perfectly natural that (with <i>Adele</i> to help
them on) a combination of virtues should take place
in America in the beautiful <i>Princess Shows</i> of Comstock
and Gest, where the talents of P. G. Wodehouse,
Guy Bolton, and Jerome Kern, stage-managed
perfectly by Robert Milton, produced a fresh and
attractive type of musical show which for five years
progressed in popularity—but had few imitators—and
suddenly seemed to disappear. It was, in fact,
transformed into something else, something good.
But one should look at the original closely to discern
its exceptional virtues.</p>

<p>Each of the Princess shows had a reasonable, but
not serious, plot. The advantage of a plot isn’t, as
one often hears, that it gives the appearance of reality
to the piece, for who should expect that? There is
no reason why a musical comedy should not be wholly
preposterous, dramatically or psychologically, provided,
like <i>Iolanthe</i>, it has a logic of its own. No.
The advantage is that when there is a definitely perceptible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
structure everything else arrives with greater
intensity of effect. The best of the Princess shows
had the weakest plot, for <i>Leave It to Jane</i> was based
on Ade’s <i>College Widow</i>, which has no great quality.
Since songs and dances had to take up much time,
this plot was gratifyingly reduced to a few essential
lines and played without sentiment. The result was
a rush of action in which everything found place.
The later pieces were on librettos by Guy Bolton,
suggesting French farces, and full of neat arrangements.
None of them was stupid. They all gave
place for Mr Wodehouse’s exceptional talents as a
lyric-writer. He is as an English humorist superior
to most, and as a master of complicated, original,
amusing rhymes is the best man in the business. A
special quality of making fun is discernible in all his
lyrics, and he does good parodies, like <i>When It’s
Nesting Time in Flatbush</i>. The Princess type made
rather a fetish of simplicity (I quote from memory):</p>

<p class="in0">and in each of these types Wodehouse was faultless.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him and for us these songs were
set to a music which in addition to being delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
let the words appear, and occasionally was so fluent,
so inevitable, that it made the words seem even simpler
and more conversational than they are. Jerome
Kern composed nearly all of the Princess shows
and the collected scores are impressive. He is the
most erudite of our simple composers and he manipulates
material with inordinate skill. He can adapt
German folksong (<i>Freut euch das Leben</i> underlies
<i>Phoebe Snow</i>); he didn’t do so well by <i>Kingdom
Comin’</i>, which was botched and cut; he also understands
Sullivan. But his best work, <i>The Siren Song</i>,
<i>The Little Ships</i>, <i>The Sun Shines Brighter</i>, have a
melodious line, a structure, and a general tidiness of
execution which are all their own. <i>The Siren Song</i>
corresponds exactly to the Viennese waltz, but both
the words and the music are impersonal; they are a
gentle hymn to seduction, with humour. Scattered
between languorous rhythms are bursts of gaiety, like
a handful of pebbles thrown against a window—which
doesn’t open—for the song ends in a tender
melancholy. It is a real achievement. Compare the
lines I have quoted above with “Come, come, I love
you only,” from <i>The Chocolate Soldier</i>—phrases you
would expect to arrive at the same musical conclusion.
The crash of “<i>Oh, Hero Mine!</i>” in the second
is good drama, saved from being too obvious by
being sung to the coward Sergius and not to the protagonist
Bluntschli. But in comparison the gentle
ending of <i>The Siren Song</i> is, as song, superior: “So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
sang the Sirens, ages and ages ago”—and you take it
or leave it. The music, at least, is not forcing your
hand.</p>

<p>The Princess shows never had any great stars;
instead, they had the one quality which always makes
for success—<i>esprit de corps</i>. In each the company
was aware of the nature and quality of the piece it
was playing, and it worked in variations of that
genial and sophisticated atmosphere. It was simply
against the tone of the Princess shows to be dull; and
I, who like nearly all musical shows, found in them
my greatest delight.</p>

<p>They passed into something else because they were
exquisitely proportioned on a small scale—the scale,
by the way of <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i>, which they resembled—and
the whole tendency of the time was
toward elaboration. They involved small choruses,
little eccentric dancing, and required no humorist
<i>hors de texte</i>. I count it a triumph for Mr Dillingham,
as well as for the others concerned, that they
have been able to preserve so much of the Princess
in some of the Globe productions. The best of these,
I think, is <i>Good-morning, Dearie</i>. It has an adequate
plot; it has room for Harland Dixon, a fine
dancer; for Ada Lewis, an expert broad comedienne;
for Maurice and his partner, whose name I don’t remember;
for a large dancing chorus and for stunts;
better still it did little to hinder Jerome Kern. It
was here that he took the most famous of waltzes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
and implicated it masterfully in a blues; and here
that all the seductiveness and gaiety of the Princess
music returned with <i>Ka-lu-a</i> and <i>Didn’t You Believe?</i>
There were a few faults in the production; the <i>décor</i>
lacked freshness, although it didn’t actually offend;
the Chinese scene was hackneyed. But on the whole
it is the best musical comedy I have seen since the
Princess shows.</p>

<p>What forced us to be elaborate was not the memory
of the Viennese type, but the growing complexity
of revue, always cutting into musical comedy. It
should be noted that <i>Around the Map</i> (which I hold
the best musical comedy—not operetta—I saw before
the Princess shows) first brought Joseph Urban into
the field, taking him from the Boston Opera House
and pushing him on the way to Ziegfeld, where he
was tardily recognized by the Metropolitan for whom
he has made <i>Oberon!</i> <i>Around the Map</i> had some
twenty scenes, it dealt with a trip around the world
in search of safety socks, and was all gay (with Else
Alder), all good music (Caryll) and only the beginning
of elaboration. But Mr Berlin’s two shows and
a host of others indicated that to survive musical
comedy would have to appear lavish. Comparatively
simple shows still occur—<i>Tangerine</i> was one; but
we seem to be in for something fairly elaborate—in
music as in the Le-Baron-Kreisler pieces, in <i>décor</i> as
in the Shubert-Century productions, in stars and stunts
as in Dillingham’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>I do not pretend to cover the ground, and to name
the names, in this sketch; not even to characterize all
the types. I don’t know what to say about <i>Mary</i>, in
which George M. Cohan worked a chorus into a state
of frantic energy and Louis Hirsch provided <i>The
Love Nest;</i> nor of twenty other individual successes.
One composer remains whose work is often so good,
whose case is so illuminating, that he must be considered.
That is Victor Herbert. It should be said
at once that even long after his early successes he
composed a fine musical comedy, <i>The Only Girl</i>.
The difficulty about Mr Herbert is that he has succumbed
to the American habit of thinking that grand
opera is great opera. I have heard him at one of
his <i>premières</i> speaking from the conductor’s dais to
assure the audience that the present piece was in the
high line of operetta, that more pieces like it would
put an end to the vulgarity of musical shows. The
regrettable fact was that <i>The Madcap Duchess</i> put
an end to nothing but itself; I recall the name, that
Ann Swinburne was in it, and that it had a good patter
song; the rest was doleful. Whereas two weeks
later in the same house I heard <i>The Lady of the Slipper</i>,
in which Mr Herbert, setting out to write an
ordinary simple musical show, was a thoroughly competent
composer, full of ingenuity and interest and
taste and invention. If he had only taken his eyes off
the Metropolitan Opera House he would probably
have been the best of the lot to-day. He suffers—although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
he is vastly respected—because he failed in
respect to the fine art of the musical show.</p>

<p>The wonderful thing about that art is that it is
made up of varied elements which are fused into
something greater than themselves. There is a song
and dance by Julia Sanderson, who is not a great artist;
or the sudden apparition of a little man pursued
in a harem, bounding upon a scarlet pouffe six feet
in diameter and nuzzling like a dog—Jimmy Barton,
in fact, who is one; and the rambling story told by
Percival Knight in <i>The Quaker Girl</i> or the drunken
scene by Clifton Crawford in <i>The Peasant Girl</i>;
there is <i>In the Night</i>, from <i>The Queen of the Movies</i>
or Johnny Dooley falling out of the clerk’s desk in
<i>Listen, Lester</i>; there is Donald Brian, the perpetual
<i>jeune premier</i>, or the amazing Spanish song in <i>Apple
Blossoms</i>, or a setting designed by Norman-Bel Geddes
or costumes by Helen Dryden or the <i>Sandman</i>
song from <i>The Dollar Princess</i>, or the entrance of
the Bulgarians in <i>The Chocolate Soldier</i> or the wickedly
expert prosody of Brian Hooker. What is it
takes all of these and composes them into something
beautiful and entertaining? Skill in production is
part of it, but not all, for the same elements: colour,
light, sound, movement, can be combined into other
forms which lack that particular air of urbanity, of
well-being, of rich contentment and interest which is
the special atmosphere of musical shows. I can only
find a word and say that the secret resides in it—high<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
spirits. For a musical comedy, even a sentimental
one, must be high-spirited in execution—that was the
lesson of an unsentimental one, <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i>;
and at the same time there must be some courage,
some defiance of nature and sound sense, a feeling
for fantasy, which means that the life of the spirit
is high, even when the life of the body is in chains.
It is for this freedom of the spirit, released by music
as always and diverted by all the other elements in
them, that these shows are cherished. It is, naturally,
as a counter-attack on solemnity that I am going to
found my theatre.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak">THE ONE-MAN SHOW</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> all the other grave æsthetic questions
about the stage are answered, some profound theorist
may explain the existence of the one-man show.
Since I am not a materialist, I cannot concede the obvious
solution—that a man finds enough money to
produce himself in a Broadway show—because there is
something attractive and mysterious about this type of
entertainment which the explanation fails to explain.</p>

<p>The theory of the one-man show is apparently
that there are individuals so endowed, so versatile,
and so beloved, that no other vehicle will suffice to
let them do their work. Conversely, that they are of
such quality that <i>they</i> suffice for the strange entertainment
with which they are surrounded and that
nothing else matters provided they are long and frequent
on the stage. Six men and two women are in
the first roster of the one-man show: Fred Stone, Ed
Wynn, Raymond Hitchcock, Eddie Cantor, Frank
Tinney, and Al Jolson; below them, leading the
women, Elsie Janis and Nora Bayes. And omitting
Jolson because he is so great that he cannot be put in
any company, the greatest one-man show was one in
which none of these appeared—it was one in which
even the man himself didn’t appear. It was a show
in which one man succeeded where all of these, this
time not excluding Jolson, had failed: for he made
the whole production <i>his kind</i> of show—and the
others have never quite managed to do more than
make themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>The chief example of this failure is Hitchcock,
whose series lapses ever so often, leaving him stranded
on the bleak shore of a <i>Pin Wheel Revue</i>—an
artistic, an intellectual, an incredibly stupid production
which Hitchy manfully tried first to save and
then to abandon. There were in the better Hitchy
shows other first-rate people: one who masqueraded
as Joseph Cook and was none other than Joe Cook
the Humorist out of vaudeville and out of his element;
Ray Dooley was with Hitchy, I believe, and
there were always good dancers. Hitchy kept on the
stage a long time, as <i>conférencier</i> and as participant,
and his amiable drollery was always at the same
level—just enough. He never quite concealed the
strain of making a production <i>go</i>; one always wanted
to be much more amused, and Hitchy never got beyond
the episode of the Captain of the Fire Brigade
or trying to buy the middle two-cent stamp in a sheet
of a hundred. A series of vaudeville sketches doesn’t
make a one-man show, even if he plays in all of them;
and the moment Hitchcock was off, <i>Hitchy-koo</i> went
to pieces, some good and some bad, and all trying a
little too hard to be something else.</p>

<p>By Roland Young</p></div></div>

<p>Eddie Cantor and Al Jolson appear in the two
different Winter Garden types of show—the Jolson
and the Winter Garden <i>in impuris naturalibus</i>. Jolson
infuses something both gay and broad into his
pieces; even the recurrence of Lawrence D’Orsay cannot
win back the original Winter Garden atmosphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and even the disappearance of Kitty Doner cannot
diminish Jolson’s private quality. Of the straight
Winter Garden shows, the 1922 with Eddie Cantor
was the best in ten years, made so by Cantor and
made by him, in spite of the billing, into a one-man
show. The nervous energy of Cantor isn’t sufficient
to animate the active, but indifferent choruses of the
Shuberts. One thing, however,
he can do superbly—the lamb led
to the slaughter. It is best when
he chooses to play the timid,
Ghetto-bred, pale-faced Jewish
lad, seduced by glory or the prospects
of pay into competing with
athletes and bruisers. One thing he cannot do and
should learn not to try—the black-face song and comedy
of his master, Jolson. The scenes of violence
vary; that of the osteopath was an exploitation of
meaningless brutality; I cared for nothing after
Eddie’s frightened entrance, “Are you the Ostermoor?”
But the aviation examination and the application
for the police force were excellent pieces
of construction, holding sympathy all the way
through and keeping on the safe side of nausea. Both
of these were before the Winter Garden days and
the Winter Garden exploit was better than either.
He played here a cutter in a hand-me-down clothing
store and it was his function to leap into the breach
whenever a customer showed the slightest tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
to leave without buying a suit. The victim was obsessed
by some idea of having “a belt in the back”
and was forced into sailor suits and fancy costume
and was generally made miserable. Eddie’s terrific
rushes from the wings, his appeals to God to strike
him dead “on the spot” if the suit now being tried
on wasn’t the best suit in the world, his helplessness
and his, “Well, kill me, so kill me,” as apology when
his partner revealed the damning fact that that happened
to be the man’s old suit—all of this was worth
the whole of the Potash-Perlmutter cycle. And the
whole-heartedness of Cantor’s violence—essentially
the bullying of a coward who has at last discovered
some one weaker than himself, was faultless. He
sings well the slightly suggestive songs like <i>After the
Ball</i> (new version), and his three broken dance steps
with the sawing motion of his gloved hands create an
image exceedingly precise and palpable. There is
in him just enough for the one-man show, but so far
it has been limited by his tendency to imitate and by
failure to develop his own sources of strength. Even
in <i>Kid Boots</i> he just fails to make the grade.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Frank Tinney</span></p>

<p>By Roland Young</p></div></div>

<p>The one-man show <i>requires</i> its leader to leave
nothing in himself unexploited—there is too much for
him to do and he must take everything on himself—the
requirements are exactly opposite to those of the
vaudeville act where the actor must work in the briefest
compass, with the utmost concentration, and get
his effects in the shortest time. Frank Tinney’s success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
in vaudeville marks the limitations of his success
in his shows—for he imposed on vaudeville that languid
easy-going manner of his and was just enough
out of vaudeville tempo (he is very deceptive in this)
to appear to be a novelty there. In essence he isn’t
a good one-man, for his line is limited
and his humour and his good-humour
(in which he is matched
only by Ed Wynn) are not capable
of the strain of a long winter’s
evening entertainment. Tinney
was excellent in a quarrel scene
with Bernard Granville (in a Ziegfeld
<i>Follies</i>, I think) the two pacing
in opposite directions, the
width of the stage between them,
always from footlights to backdrop
and never crossing the stage; he
was disputatious and entertaining
on the negative of the proposition
that the Erie railroad (pronounced
for reasons of his own, Ee-righ)
is a very expensive railroad; his
appearance in <i>Watch Your Step</i>
was almost perfect. (Consult Mr A. Woollcott’s
<i>Shouts and Murmurs</i> for everything about Tinney;
Mr Woollcott’s descriptions are accurate and evocative
and he errs only in his estimate of Tinney’s
quality.) Tinney has everything except the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
excess of vitality, the surcharge of genius. He has
method nearly to perfection and it is a wholly original,
ingratiating, and, up to a certain point, adaptable
method. What he has done is to destroy the “good
joke,” for all of Tinney’s jokes are bad ones and he
gets his effect by fumbling about with them, by
lengthening the preliminaries, by false starts, erasures,
corrections—until his arrival at the point relieves
the suspense. I have heard him take at least
ten minutes to put over: “Lend me a dollar for a
week, old man.—Who is the weak old man?” and not
a moment was superfluous. He is expert at kidding
the audience, and as he is never in character he never
steps out. There isn’t quite enough of him, that
is all.</p>

<p>There is enough of Fred Stone for versatility and
not enough for specific personal appeal. As acrobat,
dancer, ventriloquist, and cut-up Stone is easily in
the lead; but the unnamable quality is lacking. See
him climbing up an arbour to meet his Juliet in the
balcony; he is discovered, hangs head downward in
peril of his life, seizes a potted flower and with it
begins to dust the vines—it is Chaplinesque in conception
and beautifully executed. See him on the
slack rope continually on the point of falling off
and continually recovering and seeming to hang on
by his boot toe; or in <i>The Lady of the Slipper</i> making
a beautiful series of leaps from chair to divan,
from divan to table, to a triumphant exit through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
unsuspected scenery; or in another quality recall the
famous “Very good, Eddie,” of <i>Chin-Chin</i>. He is
incredible; one wouldn’t miss him
for worlds; yet it is always what
he does and not himself that constitutes
the attraction. I wonder
whether I do not wrong him altogether
by classing him with the
one-men, for it was always something
more than Montgomery and
Stone in the days of <i>The Red Mill</i>
and Stone does not exaggerate
himself on the stage. His command
of attributes is greater than
that of any other player; he does
everything with a beautiful, errorless
accuracy—and the pleasure of
seeing things <i>exactly right</i>, all the
time, is not to be underestimated.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Ed. Wynn</span></p>

<p>By Roland Young</p></div></div>

<p>It is Ed Wynn’s pleasure to
make everything seem utterly haphazard.
Wynn is a surd in the
theatre—there is always something left unresolved in
reducing him to the lowest term, and he is incommensurable
because there are no standards for him and no
similars. I prefer to see him wandering through a good
revue, changing hats, worrying about a “rewolwer”
in the first scene and stopping dead in the twentieth
to declare that it wasn’t a “rewolwer” at all, but a pistol.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
When he came to put on a one-man show he
preserved the best part of this incoherence. He made
it his business to appear before a drop curtain and
explain in an amazing vocabulary and with painstaking
gravity exactly what was to occur in the next
scene. He affects to be awkward (to quote him, I
might go so far as to call him uncouth.... I think
I <i>will</i> call him uncouth.... He is uncouth); his
gestures are florid and wide, his earnestness makes all
things vivid. Each of these explanations involves a
bad pun and none, of course, has anything to do with
the scene that actually follows. Like Jolson and
Cantor, he takes the stage at a given moment and
entertains. His famous inventions seemed to be the
crudest form of humour—a typewriter carriage for
eating corn on the cob, a burning candle to set in one’s
ears in order to wake up in time—yet sheer ebullition
carried them high into the field of “nice, clean
fun.” Wynn’s words come tumbling out of him, agglutinated,
chaotic, disorderly; he is abashed by his
own occasional temerity, he is timid and covers it
with brashness—and all of this is a carefully created
personage; it is <i>not</i> Ed Wynn. He has found a
little odd corner of life which no one else cultivates;
it is a sort of rusticity in the face of <i>simple</i> things;
he is a perpetual immigrant obsessed by hats and
shoes and words and small ideas, instead of bothering
about skyscrapers. The deepness of his zanylike
appreciation of every-day things is the secret of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
capacity for making them startling and funny. His
one fault is the show with which he surrounds himself.</p>

<p>I have never seen Elsie Janis better than she was
in <i>The Lady of the Slipper</i>—with the exception of
Gaby Deslys I have never seen any woman comparable
to Miss Janis in that piece, and in it she had
qualities which ought to have made her appearance in
an individual show a much greater success than it actually
turned out to be. For, except a voice, Miss
Janis has everything. She is a beautiful dancer and
her legs are handsomer than Mistinguett’s, and she is
the finest mimic I have ever seen on the stage, several
shades ahead of Ina Claire. An exceptional intelligence
operates in the creation of these caricatures,
for they are all created by seizing upon vital characteristics
of tone, gesture, tempo of movement, spirit;
and the arrangement of her hair and the contortions
of her face are only guide-signs to the accomplished
act. She is herself of an abounding grace, a suppleness
of body and of mind, and the measure of her
skill is the exact degree in which her grace and simplicity
are transformed into harshness or angularity
or sophistication as she passes one after another of
our stage personalities before her mirror. This year
I saw her in a Paris music-hall take off Mistinguett
and Max Dearly. She presented them singing <i>Give
Me Moonlight</i> in their own imagined versions and
her throaty “Give me a gas light” for the creator of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
<i>Mon Homme</i> was superb. She offered to sing it, at
the end, as she herself ought to sing it—and danced
it without uttering a sound. It reminded one of Irene
Castle in <i>Watch Your Step</i>. For an exact calculation
of her capacities and a sensible, modest intention
to stay within them and to exploit them to the limit
are parts of Elsie Janis’s intelligence. To be sure, it
isn’t her intelligence—it is her loveliness and her
talent that endear her to us. But it is grateful, for
once in a way, to find a talent so great, a loveliness
so irresistible, joined to an intelligence which sets all
in motion and spoils nothing.</p>

<p>I suspect that in spite of the best of the one-man
shows there is something wrong with the idea—perhaps
because the environment requires more than any
man has yet been able to give. And the one perfect
example is, as I have suggested, proof of this. Because
<i>Stop! Look! Listen!</i> which was only a moderate
success on Broadway and involved the talents of
Gaby Deslys, Doyle and Dixon, Harry Fox, Tempest
and Sunshine, the beautiful Justine Johnston, Helen
Barnes, Helen Dryden as costumer and Robert McQuinn
as scenic designer, a beautiful chorus and an
excellent producer, was actually the one-man show
of Irving Berlin. For once a complete and varied
show expressed the spirit of one man to perfection.
In that piece, Berlin wrote two of his masterpieces
and about four other superb songs; and, more than
that, suffused the entire production with the gay spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
of his music. There occurred <i>The Ragtime Melodrama</i>
danced by Doyle and Dixon—only the Common Clay
scene from the Cohan revue ever approached it, and
Doyle and Dixon never danced better (unless, possibly,
a quarter of an hour earlier in <i>The Hula-Hula</i>);
there was <i>The Girl on the Magazine Cover</i>,
perfectly set and costumed, a really good sentimental
song with its quaint introduction of <i>Lohengrin</i> (not
the <i>Wedding March</i>); there was <i>When I Get Back to
the U. S. A.</i> sung against a chorus of <i>My Country,
’Tis of Thee</i>; there was Gaby’s wicked <i>Take Off a
Little Bit</i> and Harry Fox’s <i>Press-Agent Song</i>—and
finally the second of Berlin’s three great tributes to
his art: <i>I Love a Piano</i>, which, like the mother of
Louis Napoleon, he wrote for six pianos and in which
everything in syncopation up to that time was epitomized
and carried to a perfect conclusion. Whatever
was gay, light, colourful, whatever was accurate,
assured, confident, and good-humoured, was in this
miraculous production. I saw it twelve times in two
weeks—lured partly, I must confess, by the hope that
Harry Pilcer would break at least a leg in his fall
down the golden stairs. He never did; in spite of
which, seeing it again, months later, it still seemed
to me the apotheosis of pure show. I think I could
reconstruct every moment of it, including the useless
plot and Justine Johnston’s ankles; it seems a pity
that all of it, the ephemeral and the permanent,
should have already passed from the stage. It was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
beginning in ragtime operetta which Mr Berlin has
never followed up; his inexhaustible talents have been
diverted into other things; he is now a maker of revues.
Yet when he saw <i>The Beggar’s Opera</i>, Mr
Berlin felt something plucking at his sleeve, reminding
him that it was his job, and his alone, to create
the comparable type for America.</p>

<p>At that moment he thought back to <i>Stop! Look!
Listen!</i>—but he had already begun to build the Music
Box—and we must wait patiently for what time
will bring as a real successor to his one-man show.
At any rate, we have had it. We know, now, what
it can amount to—and it is enough. Enough, at any
rate, to put the veritable one-man show fairly definitely
out of the running.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_D_MONIC_IN_THE_AMERICAN">THE DÆMONIC IN THE AMERICAN
THEATRE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> man on the American stage, and one woman,
are possessed—Al Jolson and Fanny Brice. Their
dæmons are not of the same order, but together they
represent all we have of the Great God Pan, and we
ought to be grateful for it. For in addition to being
more or less a Christian country, America is a Protestant
community and a business organization—and
none of these units is peculiarly prolific in the creation
of dæmonic individuals. We can bring forth
Roosevelts—dynamic creatures, to be sure; but the
fury and the exultation of Jolson is a hundred times
higher in voltage than that of Roosevelt; we can produce
courageous and adventurous women who shoot
lions or manage construction gangs and remain pale
beside the extraordinary “cutting loose” of Fanny
Brice.</p>

<p>To say that each of these two is possessed by a
dæmon is a mediæval and perfectly sound way of
expressing their intensity of action. It does not prove
anything—not even that they are geniuses of a fairly
high rank, which in my opinion they are. I use the
word possessed because it connotes a quality lacking
elsewhere on the stage, and to be found only at moments
in other aspects of American life—in religious
mania, in good jazz bands, in a rare outbreak of mob
violence. The particular intensity I mean is exactly
what you do not see at a baseball game, but may at
a prize fight, nor in the productions of David Belasco,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
nor at a political convention; you may see it on
the Stock Exchange and you can see it, canalized and
disciplined, but still intense, in our skyscraper architecture.
It was visible at moments in the old Russian
Ballet.</p>

<p>In Jolson there is always one thing you can be
sure of: that whatever he does he does at the highest
possible pressure. I do not mean that one gets the
sense of his effort, for his work is at times the easiest
seeming, the most effortless in the world. Only he
never saves up—for the next scene, or the next week,
or the next show. His generosity is extravagant; he
flings into a comic song or three-minute impersonation
so much energy, violence, so much of the <i>totality</i>
of one human being, that you feel it would suffice
for a hundred others. In the days when the runway
was planked down the centre of every good theatre in
America, this galvanic little figure, leaping and
shouting—yet always essentially dancing and singing—upon
it was the concentration of our national
health and gaiety. In <i>Row, Row, Row</i> he would
bounce up on the runway, propel himself by imaginary
oars over the heads of the audience, draw equally
imaginary slivers from the seat of his trousers, and
infuse into the song something wild and roaring and
insanely funny. The very phonograph record of his
famous <i>Toreador</i> song is full of vitality. Even in
later days when the programme announces simply
“Al Jolson” (about 10.15 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> in each of his reviews)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
he appears and sings and talks to the audience
and dances off—and when he has done more
than any other ten men, he returns and, blandly announcing
that “You ain’t heard nothing yet,” proceeds
to do twice as much again. He is the great
master of the one-man show because he gives so much
while he is on that the audience remains content while
he is off—and his electrical energy almost always develops
activity in those about him.</p>

</div>

<p>If it were necessary, a plea could be made for
violence <i>per se</i> in the American theatre, because
everything tends to prettify and restrain, and the energy
of the theatre is dying out. But Jolson, who
lacks discipline almost entirely, has other qualities
besides violence. He has an excellent baritone voice,
a good ear for dialect, a nimble presence, and a distinct
sense of character. Of course it would be impossible
not to recognize him the moment he appears on
the stage; of course he is always Jolson—but he is
also always Gus and always Inbad the Porter, and
always Bombo. He has created a way of being for
the characters he takes on; they live specifically in
the mad world of the Jolson show; their wit and their
bathos are singularly creditable characteristics of
themselves—not of Jolson. You may recall a scene—I
think the show was called <i>Dancing Around</i>—in
which a lady knocks at the door of a house. From
within comes the voice of Jolson singing, “You made
me love you, I didn’t wanna do it, I didn’t wanna do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
it”—the voice approaches, dwindles away, resumes—it
is a swift characterization of the lazy servant coming
to open the door and ready to insult callers, since
the master is out. Suddenly the black face leaps
through the doorway and cries out, “We don’ want no
ice,” and is gone. Or Jolson as the black slave of
Columbus, reproached by his master for a long absence.
His lips begin to quiver, his chin to tremble;
the tears are approaching, when his human independence
softly asserts itself and he wails, “We all have
our <i>moments</i>.” It is quite true, for Jolson’s technique
is the exploitation of these moments; he has
himself said that he is the greatest master of hokum
in the business, and in the theatre the art of hokum
is to make each second count for itself, to save any
moment from dulness by the happy intervention of a
slap on the back, or by jumping out of character and
back again, or any other trick. For there is no question
of legitimacy here—everything is right if it
makes ’em laugh.</p>

<p>He does more than make ’em laugh; he gives them
what I am convinced is a genuine emotional effect
ranging from the thrill to the shock. I remember
coming home after eighteen months in Europe, during
the war, and stepping from the boat to one of the
first nights of <i>Sinbad</i>. The spectacle of Jolson’s
vitality had the same quality as the impression I got
from the New York sky line—one had forgotten that
there still existed in the world a force so boundless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
an exaltation so high, and that anyone could still
storm Heaven with laughter and cheers. He sang on
that occasion <i>’N Everything</i> and <i>Swanee</i>. I have
suggested elsewhere that hearing him sing <i>Swanee</i> is
what book reviewers and young girls loosely call an
experience. I know what Jolson does with false sentiment;
here he was dealing with something which by
the grace of George Gershwin came true, and there
was no necessity for putting anything over. In the
absurd black-face which is so little negroid that it
goes well with diversions in Yiddish accents, Jolson
created image after image of longing, and his existence
through the song was wholly in <i>its</i> rhythm.
Five years later I heard Jolson in a second-rate show,
before an audience listless or hostile, sing this outdated
and forgotten song, and create again, for each
of us seated before him, the same image—and saw
also the tremendous leap in vitality and happiness
which took possession of the audience as he sang it.
It was marvelous. In the first weeks of <i>Sinbad</i> he
sang the words of <i>’N Everything</i> as they are printed.
Gradually (I saw the show in many phases) he interpolated,
improvised, always with his absolute sense
of rhythmic effect; until at the end it was a series of
amorous cries and shouts of triumph to Eros. I have
heard him sing also the absurd song about “It isn’t
raining rain, It’s raining violets” and remarked him
modulating that from sentimentality into a conscious
bathos, with his gloved fingers flittering together and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
his voice rising to absurd <i>fortissimi</i> and the general
air of kidding the piece.</p>

<p>He does not generally kid his Mammy songs—as
why should he who sings them better than anyone
else? He cannot underplay anything, he lacks restraint,
and he leans on the second-rate sentiment of
these songs until they are forced to render up the
little that is real in them. I dislike them and dislike
his doing them—as I dislike Belle Baker singing
<i>Elie, Elie!</i> But it is quite possible that my discomfort
at these exhibitions is proof of their quality.
They and a few very cheap jokes and a few sly remarks
about sexual perversions are Jolson’s only
faults. They are few. For a man who has, year
after year, established an intimate relation with no
less than a million people, every twelvemonth, he is
singularly uncorrupted. That relation is the thing
which sets him so far above all the other one-man-show
stars. Eddie Cantor gives at times the effect of
being as energetic; Wynn is always and Tinney sometimes
funnier. But no one else, except Miss Brice,
so holds an audience in the hollow of the hand. The
hand is steady; the audience never moves. And on
the great nights when everything is right, Jolson is
driven by a power beyond himself. One sees that he
knows what he is doing, but one sees that he doesn’t
half realize the power and intensity with which he
is doing it. In those moments I cannot help thinking
of him as a genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>Quite to that point Fanny Brice hasn’t reached.
She hasn’t, to begin with, the physical vitality of
Jolson. But she has a more delicate mind and a
richer humour—qualities which generally destroy
vitality altogether, and which only enrich hers. She
is first a great farceur; and in her songs she is exactly
in the tradition of Yvette Guilbert, without the
range, so far as we know, which enabled Mme Guilbert
to create the whole of mediæval France for us
in ten lines of a song. The quality, however, is the
same, and Fanny’s evocations are as vivid and as
poignant as Yvette’s—they require from us exactly
the same tribute of admiration. She has grown in
power since she sang and made immortal, <i>I Should
Worry</i>. Hear her now creating the tragedy of <i>Second-Hand
Rose</i> or of the one Florodora Baby who—“five
little dumbells got married for money, And I got married
for love....” These things are done with
two-thirds of Yvette Guilbert’s material missing, for
there are no accessories and, although the words
(some of the best are by Blanche Merrill) are good,
the music isn’t always distinguished. And the effects
are irreproachable. Give Fanny a song she can
get her teeth into, <i>Mon Homme</i>, and the result is less
certain, but not less interesting. This was one of a
series of realistic songs for Mistinguett, who sang it
very much as Yvonne George did when she appeared
in America. Miss Brice took it <i>lento affetuoso</i>; since
the precise character of the song had changed a bit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
from its rather more outspoken French original. Miss
Brice suppressed Fanny altogether in this song—she
was being, I fear, “a serious artist”; but she is of such
an extraordinary talent that she can do even this.
Yvonne George sang it better simply because the
figure she evoked as Mon Homme was exactly the
fake apache about whom it was written, and not the
“my feller” who lurked behind Miss Brice. It was
amusing to learn that without a Yiddish accent and
without those immense rushes of drollery, without
the enormous gawkishness of her other impersonations,
Miss Brice could put a song over. But I am
for Fanny against Miss Brice and to Fanny I return.</p>

<p>Fanny is one of the few people who “make fun.”
She creates that peculiar quality of entertainment
which is wholly light-hearted and everything else is
added unto her. Of this special quality nothing can
be said; one either sees it or doesn’t, savours it or not.
Fanny arrives on the scene with an indescribable gesture—after
seeing it twenty times I believe that it
consists of a feminine salute, touching the forehead
and then flinging out her arm to the topmost gallery.
There is magic in it, establishing her character at once—the
magic must reside in her incredible elbow. She
hasn’t so much to give as Jolson, but she gives it with
the same generosity, there are no reserves, and it is
all for fun. Her Yiddish Squow (how else can I
spell that amazing effect?) and her Heiland Lassie
are examples—there isn’t an <i>arrière-pensée</i> in them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
“The Chiff is after me ... he says I appil to him
... he likes my type ...” it is the complete
give away of herself and she doesn’t care.</p>

</div>

<p>And this carelessness goes through her other exceptional
qualities of caricature and satire. For the
first there is the famous Vamp, in which she plays the
crucial scene of all the vampire stories, preluding it
with the first four lines of the poem Mr Kipling
failed to throw into the wastepaper basket, and fatuously
adding, “I can’t get over it”—after which point
everything is flung into another plane—the hollow
laughter, the haughty gesture, the pretended compassion,
that famous defense of the vampire which here,
however, ends with the magnificent line, “I may be a
bad woman, but I’m awful good company.” In this
brief episode she does three things at once: recites a
parody, imitates the moving-picture vamp, and
creates through these another, truly comic character.
For satire it is Fanny’s special quality that with the
utmost economy of means she always creates the
original in the very process of destroying it, as in two
numbers which are exquisite, her present opening
song in vaudeville with its reiterations of Victor Herbert’s
<i>Kiss Me Again</i>, and her Spring Dance. The
first is pressed far into burlesque, but before she gets
there it has fatally destroyed the whole tedious business
of polite and sentimental concert-room vocalism;
and the second (Fanny in ballet, with her amazingly
angular parody of five-position dancing) puts an end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
forever to that great obsession of ours, classical interpretative
dancing.</p>

<p>Fanny’s refinement of technique is far beyond
Jolson’s; her effects are broad enough, but her
methods are all delicate. The frenzy which takes
hold of her is as real as his. With him she has the
supreme pleasure of knowing that she can do no
wrong—and her spirits mount and intensify with
every moment on the stage. She creates rapidly and
her characterizations have an exceptional roundness
and fulness; when the dæmon attends she is superb.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that these two stars bring something
to America which America lacks and loves—they
are, I suppose, two of our most popular entertainers—and
that both are racially out of the dominant
caste. Possibly this accounts for their fine carelessness
about our superstitions of politeness and
gentility. The medium in which they work requires
more decency and less frankness than usually exist in
our private lives; but within these bounds Jolson and
Brice go farther, go with more contempt for artificial
notions of propriety, than anyone else. Jolson has
re-created an ancient type, the scalawag servant with
his surface dulness and hidden cleverness, a creation
as real as Sganarelle. And Fanny has torn through
all the conventions and cried out that gaiety still
exists. They are parallel lines surcharged with vital
energy. I should like to see that fourth-dimensional
show in which they will meet.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Remy de Gourmont</span> has propounded, somewhere,
an interesting theory. If life is worth anything
<i>per se</i>, is the substance of the argument, then
we do wrong to live it in a series of high moments
separated by long hours of dulness. We ought to
take the <i>amount</i> of energy, or ecstasy, we possess, and
spread it as thin as possible, relishing each moment
for itself, each being as good as any other. (I do not
mean that Gourmont endorsed this philosophy; he
discussed it.) It is, of course, the logical conclusion
of burning <i>always</i> with a hard gemlike flame, for if
one is to be always <i>anything</i> it is more likely to be
calm and languorous and reserved; that is the difference
between burning and burning up—of which
Pater was aware.</p>

<p>We have all had these days of halcyon perfection,
when the precise degree of warmth was a
miracle, when the aroma of a wine seemed to have
the whole fragrance of the earth, when one could do
anything or nothing and be equally content. In the
presence of great works of art we experience something
similar. We are suspended between the sense
of release from life, the desire to die before the image
of the supremely beautiful, and a new-found capacity
for living. Our daily existence gives us no such
opportunity; we cannot live languorously because we
have no leisure, and we are compelled to be intense
at rare intervals if life isn’t to be entirely a hoax and
a bore. In the preoccupations of daily life a tragic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
incident or an outburst of temper or a perfectly cut
street dress or the dark-light before a storm, may give
us, apart from our emotional lives, the intensity we
require. We rather defend ourselves from the impact
of great beauty, of nobility, of high tragedy, because
we feel ourselves incompetent to master them;
we preserve our individual lives even if we diminish
them.</p>

<p>The minor arts are, to an extent, an opiate—or
rather they trick our hunger for a moment and we are
able to sleep. They do not wholly satisfy, but they
do not corrupt. And they, too, have their moments
of intensity. Our experience of perfection is so limited
that even when it occurs in a secondary field
we hail its coming. Yet the minor arts are all transient,
and these moments have no lasting record, and
their creators are unrewarded even by the tribute of a
word. A moment comes when everything is exactly
right, and you have an occurrence—it may be something
exquisite or something unnamably gross; there
is in it an ecstasy which sets it apart from everything
else. The scene of the “swaree” in the <i>Pickwick
Papers</i> has that quality; nearly the whole of <i>South
Wind</i> has it (I choose examples as disparate as possible).
The whole performance of <i>Boris</i> by Chaliapin
(the second time he sang it at the Metropolitan
on his second visit to the United States) had precisely
the same exaltation—and Conrad Veidt as
Cesare had one comparable moment: the breathless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
second when the draperies seem to cling to the ravished
virgin in the hands of the Somnambulist. It
is an unpredictable event; but there are those on
whom one can count to approach it. All of those I
am writing about here have given me that thrill at
least once—and my memory goes back to these occasions,
trying to catch the incredible moment again.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be impossible to communicate even the
sense of it unless the material be dissociated from the
event. Surely there is nothing exquisite in the roaring
charwoman created by George Monroe. He had
to an inspiring degree the capacity to be one of those
vast figures in Dickens—Mrs Gamp to perfection—and
it is odd that another impersonator, Bert Savoy,
should have created, in Margie, Mrs Gamp’s own
confidante and admirer, the devoted Mrs Harris.
George Monroe’s creation was huge and cylindrical—more
like a drainpipe than a woman in shape. There
was no effort at realism, for Monroe roared in a deep
bass voice, and his “Be that as it ma-a-y” was a leer
in the face of all logic, order, and decency. There
was in it an unrestraint, a wildness, an independent
commonness which rendered it immortal. The creation
of Bert Savoy is at the other extreme. It is
female impersonation and the figure is always the
same—the courtesan whose ambition it is to be a
demi-mondaine. Savoy makes capital of all his defects
down to the rakish slanting hat over one eye.
His repetitions, apparently so spontaneous, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
beautifully timed and spaced; the buzz and pause in
the voice—“you muzzt com’over ... you don’t
know the ha-ff of it, dear-ie” fix themselves in memory.
He is remembered for the excellent stories he
tells, and they are worth it, but the interpolations
are funnier than the climax. The audacity is colossal
and disarming. The occurrence of a character out of
Petronius on our stage is exceptional in itself, that it
should at the same time be slightly vicious and altogether
charming, funny and immoral and delicate, is
the wonder.</p>

<p>Last year there was an added touch, when Savoy
danced while he sang a stanza about the Widow
Brown. It was as delicate, it passed as quickly, as
breath on a windowpane.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>I repeat the material doesn’t matter. For Leon
Errol has nothing but the type drunkard to work
with, and is wonderful. In his case it is easy to
analyse the basis of the effect—it is in the loping
dance step into which he converts the lurch of the
drunkard. The tawdry moment—funny enough if
you can bear it—is always Errol’s breathing into
someone else’s face; the great moment comes directly
after, when the lurch and the fall are worked up into
a complete arc of dance steps, ending in three little
hops as a sort of proof of sobriety. Jimmy Barton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
has the same quality in his skating scene—he uses less
material and the movement round the rink is beautiful
to watch. But of him it is useless to speak.
Someone has pointed out that he can slap the bare
back of a woman and make that funny!</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how many of the people
who give this special quality arrive out of burlesque.
Harry Kelly is another. I recall him first with Lizzie
the Fish Hound in <i>Watch Your Step</i> and last in a
quite useless musical comedy, <i>The Springtime of
Youth</i> (textually that was the title—and in 1922!)
For two acts he was wholly wasted. In the third he
was magnificent. He was playing the obdurate
father: “No son of mine shall ever marry a daughter
of the Baxters” was his line. He was informed that
she was, in fact, an adopted daughter and that her
uncle had left her the bulk of his fortune. For precisely
a minute and a half Kelly played with the
word “bulk”—one saw it registered in his brain, saw
an idea germinating, felt it working forward to the
jaw before the cavernous voice gave it utterance—and
again one felt the inner struggle <i>not</i> to say it a
third time, one felt the conflict of pride and avarice.
It was remarkably delicate and fine—so is all of
Kelly’s work when he has a chance. His spare figure,
long hands, and unbelievable voice always create a
character—and it isn’t always the same character.</p>

<p>Bobby Clarke’s scene with the lion comes at once
to mind (it is another burlesque act), and Bert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
Williams—in many scenes—always soft spoken, always
understanding his case. There were five minutes
of Blanche Ring and Charles Winninger, once, at the
Winter Garden; to my surprise, there were more than
that for Eugene and Willie Howard at the same
house, but they were gained in spite of the Winter
Garden technique which underestimates even the
lowest intelligence. Willie is rather like Fanny Brice
at moments; when he cuts loose one has an agreeable
sense of uncertainty. Joe Jackson,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> actually a great
clown, although one doesn’t recognize this in the highly
developed medium he chooses, has exactly the opposite
effect—he doesn’t cut loose at all; he develops.
Everything he does is careful and nothing exaggerated,
so you think at first that, although he will be
funny, he will not quite reach that top notch on which
an artist teeters perilously while you wonder whether
he will fall over or keep his balance. Yet Jackson
gets there. As the tramp cyclist his acrobatics are
good, his make-up enchanting; but his expressed attitude
of mind is his most precious quality. It becomes
almost too much to watch him worrying with a motor
horn which has become detached from the handlebars
and which he cannot replace. He tries it everywhere;
at the end he is miserably trying to hang it up on the
air, and when it fails to catch there he is actually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
wretched. His movements are full of grace—like
those of the grotesque, Alberto, among the Fratellini—and
the ecstasy he gives comes by a surexcess of
laughter. Another moment of great delicacy, without
laughter, however, is that in which Fortunello
and Cirrilino swing about on the broomstick. They
are a lovely pair, and the little one seated on the
palm of the other’s hand is a beautiful picture.</p>

<p>Either few women are brought out of burlesque,
or women haven’t the exceptional quality I care for.
In any case they have seldom given me the excess of
emotion by what they have done. Their beauty is
quite another matter on which I fail to commit myself.
Ada Lewis, in her broad and grand way, has
the stuff, and Florence Moore. And once in each performance
you can be sure that Gilda Grey will utter
a sound or tremble herself into a bacchanalian revel.
For the most part her singing is undistinguished, and
I do not care for the anxious way in which she regards
her members, as if she fancied they would fall off by
dint of shimmying. Yet I have never gone to a show
of hers without hearing some echo of the nymphs pursued,
or seeing a movement of abandon and grace.
The dark shuddering voice is sub-human, the movement
divinely animal.</p>

<p>Different in every way, but exquisite in every
way, was Gaby Deslys. It is good form now to belittle
her; she was so vulgar; she came so much on the
crest of a revolution, she was such a bidder for our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
great precious commodity—news space. Ah, well!
we have given publicity to less worthy causes. For
she was perfect of her type, and in her hard, calculating,
sublimely decent way she made us like the
type. It was gently vicious—the whole manner. It
was overdone—the pearls and the peacock feathers.
But behind was a lovely person—lovely to look at
and enchanting to all the senses. No, she couldn’t
act—how pitiable her loyal efforts; she sang badly;
she wasn’t one of the world’s great dancers. But she
had something irreducible, not to be hindered or infringed
upon—her definite self. She was, to begin
with, outcast of our moral system, and she made us
accept her because she was an independent human
being. She had a sound and accurate sense of her
personal life, of her rights as an individual. Nothing
could stand against her—and it is said that when
she was at grips, at the end, with something more
powerful than popular taste, she still held her own,
and died rather than suffer the spoiling of her beauty.
If that were true one could hardly wish even her
beauty back again.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_VULGAR_COMIC_STRIP">THE “VULGAR” COMIC STRIP</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Of</span> all the lively arts the Comic Strip is the most
despised, and with the exception of the movies it is
the most popular. Some twenty million people follow
with interest, curiosity, and amusement the daily
fortunes of five or ten heroes of the comic strip, and
that they do this is considered by all those who have
any pretentions to taste and culture as a symptom of
crass vulgarity, of dulness, and, for all I know, of
defeated and inhibited lives. I need hardly add that
those who feel so about the comic strip only infrequently
regard the object of their distaste.</p>

<p>Certainly there is a great deal of monotonous stupidity
in the comic strip, a cheap jocosity, a life-of-the-party
humour which is extraordinarily dreary.
There is also a quantity of bad drawing and the intellectual
level, if that matters, is sometimes not high.
Yet we are not actually a dull people; we take our
fun where we find it, and we have an exceptional
capacity for liking the things which show us off in
ridiculous postures—a counterpart to our inveterate
passion for seeing ourselves in stained-glass attitudes.
And the fact that we do care for the comic strip—that
Jiggs and Mutt-and-Jeff and Skinnay and the
Gumps have entered into our existence as definitely
as Roosevelt and more deeply than Pickwick—ought
to make them worth looking at, for once. Certainly
they would have been more sharply regarded if they
had produced the counterpart of Chaplin in the comic
film—a universal genius capable of holding the multitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
and exciting the speculations of the intellectuals.
It happens that the actual genius of the comic
strip, George Herriman, is of such a special sort that
even when he is recognized he is considered something
apart and his appearance among other strips is
held to be only an accident.</p>

<p>It is by no means an accident, for the comic strip
is an exceptionally supple medium, giving play to a
variety of talents, to the use of many methods, and
it adapts itself to almost any theme. The enormous
circulation it achieves imposes certain limitations:
it cannot be too local, since it is syndicated throughout
the country; it must avoid political and social
questions because the same strip appears in papers of
divergent editorial opinions; there is no room in it for
acute racial caricature, although no group is immune
from its mockery. These and other restrictions have
gradually made of the comic strip a changing picture
of the average American life—and by compensation
it provides us with the freest American fantasy.</p>

<p>In a book which appeared about two years ago,
<i>Civilization in the United States</i>, thirty Americans
rendered account of our present state. One of them,
and one only, mentioned the comic strip—Mr Harold
E. Stearns—and he summed up the “intellectual”
attitude perfectly by saying that <i>Bringing Up Father</i>
will repay the social historian for all the attention he
gives it. I do not know in what satisfactions the
social historian can be repaid. I fear that the actual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
fun in the comic strip is not one of them. <i>Bringing
Up Father</i>, says Mr Stearns, “symbolizes better than
most of us appreciate the normal relation of American
men and women to cultural and intellectual values.
<i>Its very grotesqueness and vulgarity are revealing</i>”
(italics mine). (Query: Is it vulgar of Jiggs to prefer
Dinty’s café to a Swami’s lecture? Or of Mrs
Jiggs to insist on the lecture? Or of both of them to
be rather free in the matter of using vases as projectiles?
What, in short, is vulgar?) I am far from
quarreling with Mr Stearns’ leading idea, for I am
sure that a history of manners in the United States
could be composed with the comic strip as its golden
thread; but I think that something more than its vulgarity
would be revealing.</p>

<p>The daily comic strip arrived in the early ’nineties—perhaps
it was our contribution to that artistic
age—and has gone through several phases. In 1892
or thereabouts Jimmy Swinnerton created <i>Little
Bears and Tigers</i> for the San Francisco <i>Examiner</i>;
that forerunner has passed away, but Swinnerton remains,
and everything he does is observed with
respect by the other comic-strip artists; he has had
more influence on the strip even than Wilhelm Busch,
the German whose <i>Max und Moritz</i> were undoubtedly
the originals of the <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i>. The
strip worked its way east, prospered by William
Randolph Hearst especially in the coloured Sunday
Supplement, and as a daily feature by the Chicago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
<i>Daily News</i>, which was, I am informed, the first to
syndicate its strips and so enabled Americans to think
nationally. About fifteen years ago, also in San
Francisco, appeared the first work of Bud Fisher, <i>Mr
Mutt</i>, soon to develop into <i>Mutt and Jeff</i>, the first
of the great hits and still one of the best known of
the comic strips. Fisher’s arrival on the scene corresponds
to that of Irving Berlin in ragtime. He had
a great talent, hit upon something which took the
popular fancy, and by his energy helped to establish
the comic strip as a fairly permanent idea in the
American newspaper.</p>

<p>The files of the San Francisco <i>Chronicle</i> will one
day be searched by an enthusiast for the precise date
on which Little Jeff appeared in the picture. It is
generally believed that the two characters came on
together, but this is not so. In the beginning Mr
Mutt made his way alone; he was a race-track follower
who daily went out to battle and daily fell.
Clare Briggs had used the same idea in his <i>Piker Clerk</i>
for the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>. The historic meeting with
Little Jeff, a sacred moment in our cultural development,
occurred during the days before one of Jim
Jeffries’ fights. It was as Mr Mutt passed the asylum
walls that a strange creature confided to the air the
notable remark that he himself was Jeffries. Mutt
rescued the little gentleman and named him Jeff.
In gratitude Jeff daily submits to indignities which
might otherwise seem intolerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

<p>The development in the last twenty years has
been rapid, and about two dozen good comics now
exist. Historically it remains to be noted that between
1910 and 1916 nearly all the good comics were
made into bad burlesque shows; in 1922 the best of
them was made into a ballet with scenario and music
by John Alden Carpenter, choreography by Adolph
Bolm; costumes and settings after designs by George
Herriman. Most of the comics have also appeared
in the movies; the two things have much in common
and some day a thesis for the doctorate in letters will
be written to establish the relationship. The writer
of that thesis will explain, I hope, why “movies” is
a good word and “funnies,” as offensive little children
name the comic pages, is what charming essayists
call an atrocious vocable.</p>

<p>Setting apart the strip which has fantasy—it is
practised by Frueh and by Herriman—the most interesting
form is that which deals satirically with
every-day life; the least entertaining is the one which
takes over the sentimental magazine love-story and
carries it through endless episodes. The degree of
interest points to one of the virtues of the comic strip:
it is a great corrective to magazine-cover prettiness.
Only one or two frankly pretty-girl strips exist.
<i>Petey</i> is the only one which owes its popularity to the
high, handsome face and the lovely flanks of its
heroine, and even there the pompous awkwardness of
the persistent lover has a touch of wilful absurdity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Mrs Trubble, a second-rate strip unworthy of its
originator, is simply a series of pictures dramatizing
the vampire home-breaker; I am not even sure she is
intended to be pretty. When nearly everything else
in the same newspapers is given over to sentimentality
and affected girl-worship, to advice to the lovelorn
and pretty-prettiness, it is notable that the comic
strip remains grotesque and harsh and careless. It
is largely concerned with the affairs of men and children,
and, as far as I know, there has never been an
effective strip made by, for, or of a woman. The
strip has been from the start a satirist of manners;
remembering that it arrived at the same time as the
Chicago World’s Fair, recalling the clothes, table
manners, and conversation of those days, it is easy to
see how the murmured satiric commentary of the strip
undermined our self-sufficiency, pricked our conceit,
and corrected our <i>gaucherie</i>. To-day the world of
Tad, peopled with cake-eaters and finale-hoppers,
the world of the <i>Gumps</i> and <i>Gasoline Alley</i>, of <i>Abie
the Agent</i> and <i>Mr and Mrs</i> serve the same purpose.
I am convinced that none of our realists in fiction
come so close to the facts of the average man, none
of our satirists are so gentle and so effective. Of
course they are all more serious and more conscious
of their mission; but—well, exactly who cares?</p>

  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">Mike and Mike.</span> By T. E. Powers</div>
</div>

<p>The best of the realists is Clare Briggs, who is an
elusive creator, one who seems at times to feel the
medium of the strip not exactly suited to him, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
at others to find himself at home in it. His single
pictures: <i>The Days of Real Sport</i> and <i>When a Feller
Needs a Friend</i>, and the now rapidly disappearing
<i>Kelly Pool</i> which was technically a strip, are notable
recreations of simple life. Few of them are actively
funny; some are sentimental. The children of <i>The
Days of Real Sport</i> have an astonishing reality—and
none are more real than the virtually unseen
Skinnay, who is always being urged to “come over.”
They are a gallery of country types, some of them
borrowed from literature—the Huck Finn touch is
visible—but all of them freshly observed and dryly
recorded. Briggs’ line is distinctive; one could identify
any square inch of his drawings. In <i>Kelly Pool</i>
he worked close to Tad’s <i>Indoor Sports</i>, and did what
Tad hasn’t done—created a character, the negro
waiter George whom I shall be sorry to lose. George’s
amateur interest in pool was continually being submerged
in his professional interest: gettings tips, and
his “Bad day ... ba-a-ad day” when tips were low
is a little classic. Deserting that scene, Briggs has
made a successful comedy of domestic life in <i>Mr and
Mrs</i>. No one has come so near to the subject—the
grumbling, helpless, assertive, modest, self-satisfied,
self-deprecating male, in his contacts with his sensible,
occasionally irritable, wife. As often as not these
episodes end in quarrels—in utter blackness with
harsh bedroom voices continuing a day’s exacerbations;
again the reconciliations are mushy, again they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
are genuine sentiment. And around them plays the
child whose one function is to say “Papa loves
mamma” at the most appropriate time. It is quite
an achievement, for Briggs has made the ungrateful
material interesting, and I can recall not one of these
strips in which he has cracked a joke. Tad here follows
Briggs, respectfully. <i>For Better or Worse</i> is
considerably more obvious, but it has Tad’s special
value, in sharpness of caricature. The surrounding
types are brilliantly drawn; only the central
characters remain stock figures. Yet the touch of romance
in Tad, continually overlaid by his sense of
the ridiculous, is precious; he seems aware of the
faint aspirations of his characters and recognizes the
<i>rôles</i> which they think they are playing while he mercilessly
shows up their actuality. The finest of the
<i>Indoor Sports</i> are those in which two subordinate
characters riddle with sarcasm the pretentions of the
others—the clerk pretending to be at ease when the
boss brings his son into the office, the lady of the
house talking about the new motor car, the small-town
braggart and the city swell—characters out of
melodrama, some, and others so vividly taken from
life that the very names Tad gives them pass into
common speech. He is an inveterate creator and
manipulator of slang; whatever phrase he makes or
picks up has its vogue for months and his own variations
are delightful. Slang is a part of their picture,
and he and Walter Hoban are the only masters of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<p>Ketten’s <i>Day of Rest</i> is another strip of this
<i>genre</i>, interesting chiefly as a piece of draughtsmanship.
He is the most economical of the comic-strip
artists, and his flat characters, without contours or
body, have a sort of jack-in-the-box energy and a
sardonic obstinacy. The Chicago School I have
frankly never been able to understand—a parochialism
on my part, or a tribute to its exceptional privacy
and sophistication. It pretends, of course, to be
simple, but the fate of every metropolis is to enter
its small-town period at one time or another, to call
itself a village, to build a town hall and sink a town
pump with a silver handle. The Gumps are common
people and the residents of Gasoline Alley are
just folks, but I have never been able to understand
what they are doing; I suspect they do nothing. It
seems to me I read columns of conversation daily,
and have to continue to the next day to follow the
story. The campaign of Andy Gump for election
to the Senate gave a little body to the serial story—he
was so abysmally the ignorant Congressman that
he began to live. But apart from this, apart from the
despairing cry of “Oh, Min,” one recalls nothing of
the Chicago School except the amusing vocabulary of
Syd Smith and that Andy has no chin. It is an excellent
symbol; but it isn’t enough for daily food.</p>

<p>The small-town school of comic strip flourishes
in the work of Briggs, already mentioned, in Webster’s
swift sketches of a similar nature, and in Tom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
MacNamara’s <i>Us Boys</i>. The last of these is an exceptional
fake as small-town, but an amusing and
genuine strip. It is people by creation of fancy—the
alarmingly fat, amiable Skinny, the truculent Eaglebeak
Spruder, the little high-brow Van with his innocence
and his spectacles, and Emily, if I recall the
name, the village vampire at the age of seven. Little
happens in <i>Us Boys</i>, but MacNamara has managed to
convey a genuine emotion in tracing the complicated
relations between his personages—there is actual
childhood friendship, actual worry and pride and anger—all
rather gently rendered, and with a recognizable
language.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that none of these strips
make use of the projectile or the blow as a regular
<i>dénoûement</i>. I have nothing against the solution by
violence of delicate problems, but since the comic strip
is supposed to be exclusively devoted to physical exploits
I think it is well to remark how placid life is
in at least one significant branch of the art. In
effect all the themes of the comic strip are subjected
to a great variety of treatments, and in each of them
you will find, on occasions, the illustrated joke. This
is the weakest of the strips, and, as if aware of its
weakness, its creators give it the snap ending of a
blow, or, failing that, show us one character in consternation
at the brilliance of the other’s wit, flying
out of the picture with the cry of “Zowie,” indicating
his surcharge of emotion. This is not the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
thing as the wilful violence of <i>Mutt and Jeff</i>, where
the attack is due to the malice or stupidity of one
character, the resentment or revenge of the other.</p>

<p>Mutt is a <i>picaro</i>, one of the few rogues created
in America. There is nothing too dishonest for him,
nor is there any chance so slim that he won’t take it.
He has an object in life: he does not do mean or vicious
things simply for the pleasure of doing them,
and so is vastly superior to the Peck’s Bad Boy type
of strip which has an apparently endless vogue—the
type best known in <i>The Katzenjammer Kids</i>.
This is the least ingenious, the least interesting as
drawing, the sloppiest in colour, the weakest in conception
and in execution, of all the strips, and it is
the one which has determined the intellectual idea
of what all strips are like. It is now divided into
two—and they are equally bad. How happy one
could be with neither! The other outstanding picaresque
strip is <i>Happy Hooligan</i>—the type tramp—who
with his brother, Gloomy Gus, had added to the
gallery of our national mythology. <i>Non est qualis
erat</i>—the spark has gone out of him in recent years.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
Elsewhere you still find that exceptionally immoral
and dishonest attitude toward the business standards
of America. For the comic strip, especially after
you leave the domestic-relations type which is itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
realistic and unsentimental, is specifically more
violent, more dishonest, more tricky and roguish, than
America usually permits its serious arts to be. The
strips of cleverness: <i>Foxy Grandpa</i>, the boy inventor,
<i>Hawkshaw the Detective</i>, haven’t great vogue. <i>Boob
McNutt</i>, without a brain in his head, beloved by the
beautiful heiress, has a far greater following, although
it is the least worthy of Rube Goldberg’s
astonishing creations. But Mutt and Jiggs and <i>Abie
the Agent</i>, and <i>Barney Google</i> and <i>Eddie’s Friends</i>
have so little respect for law, order, the rights of
property, the sanctity of money, the romance of marriage,
and all the other foundations of American life,
that if they were put into fiction the Society for the
Suppression of Everything would hale them incontinently
to court and our morals would be saved again.</p>

<p><i>The Hall-room Boys</i> (now known as <i>Percy and
Ferdy</i>, I think) are also picaresque; the indigent pretenders
to social eminence who do anything to get
on. They are great bores, not because one foresees
the denunciation at the end, but because they somehow
fail to come to life, and one doesn’t care whether
they get away with it or not.</p>

<p><i>Abie</i> and <i>Jerry on the Job</i> are good strips because
they are self-contained, seldom crack jokes, and
have each a significant touch of satire. Abie is the
Jew of commerce and the man of common sense; you
have seen him quarrel with a waiter because of an
overcharge of ten cents, and, encouraged by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
companion, replying, “Yes, and it ain’t the principle,
either; it’s the ten cents.” You have seen a thousand
tricks by which he once sold Complex motor cars and
now promotes cinema shows or prize fights. He is
the epitome of one side of his race, and his attractiveness
is as remarkable as his jargon. Jerry’s chief
fault is taking a stock situation and prolonging it;
his chief virtue, at the moment, is his funny, hard-boiled
attitude towards business. Mr Givney, the
sloppy sentimentalist who is pleased because some one
took him for Mr Taft (“Nice, clean fun,” says Jerry
of that), is faced with the absurd Jerry, who demolishes
efficiency systems and the romance of big business
and similar nonsense with his devastating logic
or his complete stupidity. The railway station at
Ammonia hasn’t the immortal character of <i>The Toonerville
Trolley</i> (that meets all the trains) because
Fontaine Fox has a far more entertaining manner
than Hoban, and because Fox is actually a caricaturist—all
of his figures are grotesque, the powerful
<i>Katinka</i> or <i>Aunt Eppie</i> not more so than the Skipper.
Hoban and Hershfield both understate; Fox
exaggerates grossly; but with his exaggeration he is
so ingenious, so inventive that each strip is funny
and the total effect is the creation of character in
the Dickens sense. It is not the method of <i>Mutt and
Jeff</i> nor of <i>Barney Google</i> in which Billy de Beck
has done much with a luckless wight, a sentimentalist,
and an endearing fool all rolled into one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span></p>

<p>These are the strips which come to life each day,
without forcing, and which stay long in memory. I
am stating the case for the strip in general and have
gone so far as to speak well of some I do not admire,
nor read with animation. The continued existence
of others remains a mystery to me; why they live
beyond change, and presumably beyond accidental
death, is one of the things no one can profitably speculate
upon. I do not see why I should concede anything
more to the enemies of the strip. In one of
<i>Life’s</i> burlesque numbers there was a page of comics
expertly done by j held in the manner of our most
popular artists. Each of the half dozen strips illustrated
the joke: “Who was that lady I seen you with
on the street last night?” “That wasn’t a lady; that
was my wife.” Like so many parodies, this arrived
too late, for the current answer is, “That wasn’t a
street; that was an alley.” Each picture ended in a
slam and a cry—also belated. The actual demolition
of the slam ending was accomplished by T. E. Powers,
who touches the field of the comic strip rarely,
and then with his usual ferocity. In a footnote to
a cartoon he drew <i>Mike and Mike</i>. In six pictures
four represented one man hitting the other; once to
emphasize a pointless joke, twice thereafter for no
reason at all, and finally to end the picture. It was
destruction by exaggeration; and no comic strip artist
missed the point.</p>

<p>At the extremes of the comic strip are the realistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
school and the fantastic—and of fantasy there
are but few practitioners. Tad has some of the quality
in <i>Judge Rummy</i>, but for the most part the Judge
and Fedink and the rest are human beings dressed
up as dogs—they are out of Æsop, not out of LaFontaine.
But the Judge is actually funny, and I recall
an inhuman and undoglike episode in which he and
Fedink each claimed to have the loudest voice, and
so in midwinter, in a restaurant, each lifted up his
voice and uttered and shouted and bellowed the word
“Strawberries” until they were properly thrown into
the street. This is the kind of madness which is required
in fantasy, and Goldberg occasionally has it.
He is the most versatile of the lot; he has created
characters, and scenes, and continuous episodes—foolish
questions and meetings of ladies’ clubs and
inventions (not so good as Heath Robinson’s) and
through them there has run a wild grotesquerie. The
tortured statues of his <i>décors</i> are marvelous, the way
he pushes stupidity and ugliness to their last possible
point, and humour into everything, is amazing. Yet
I feel he is <i>manqué</i>, because he has never found a
perfect medium for his work.</p>

<p>Frueh is a fine artist in caricature and could have
no such difficulty. When he took it into his head to
do a daily strip he was bound to do something exceptional,
and he succeeded. It is a highly sophisticated
thing in its humour, in its subjects, and pre-eminently
in its execution. His series on prohibition enforcement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
had infinite ingenuity, so also his commentaries
on political events in New York city. He remains
a caricaturist in these strips, indicating, by his use of
the medium, that its possibilities are not exhausted.
Yet for all his dealing with “ideas” his method remains
fantastic, and although he isn’t technically a
comic-strip artist he is the best approach to the one
artist whom I have only mentioned, George Herriman,
and to his immortal creation. For there is, in
and outside the comic strip, a solitary and incomprehensible
figure which must be treated apart. The
Krazy Kat that Walks by Himself.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">Krazy Kat,</span> the daily comic strip of George Herriman
is, to me, the most amusing and fantastic and
satisfactory work of art produced in America to-day.
With those who hold that a comic strip cannot be a
work of art I shall not traffic. The qualities of Krazy
Kat are irony and fantasy—exactly the same, it would
appear, as distinguish <i>The Revolt of the Angels</i>;
it is wholly beside the point to indicate a preference
for the work of Anatole France, which is in the great
line, in the major arts. It happens that in America
irony and fantasy are practised in the major arts by
only one or two men, producing high-class trash; and
Mr Herriman, working in a despised medium, without
an atom of pretentiousness, is day after day producing
something essentially fine. It is the result
of a naïve sensibility rather like that of the <i>douanier</i>
Rousseau; it does not lack intelligence, because it is
a thought-out, a constructed piece of work. In the
second order of the world’s art it is superbly first
rate—and a delight! For ten years, daily and frequently
on Sunday, Krazy Kat has appeared in America;
in that time we have accepted and praised a hundred
fakes from Europe and Asia—silly and trashy
plays, bad painting, woful operas, iniquitous religions,
everything paste and brummagem, has had its vogue
with us; and a genuine, honest native product has
gone unnoticed until in the year of grace 1922 a
ballet brought it a tardy and grudging acclaim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<p>Herriman is our great master of the fantastic
and his early career throws a faint light on the invincible
creation which is his present masterpiece. For
all of his other things were comparative failures. He
could not find, in the realistic framework he chose,
an appropriate medium for his imaginings, or even
for the strange draughtsmanship which is his natural
mode of expression. <i>The Family Upstairs</i> seemed to
the realist reader simply incredible; it failed to give
him the pleasure of recognizing his neighbours in
their more ludicrous moments. <i>The Dingbats</i>, hapless
wretches, had the same defect. Another strip
came nearer to providing the right tone: <i>Don Koyote
and Sancho Pansy</i>; Herriman’s mind has always been
preoccupied with the mad knight of La Mancha, who
reappears transfigured in <i>Krazy Kat</i>. And—although
the inspirations are <i>never</i> literary—when it isn’t Cervantes
it is Dickens to whom he has the greatest affinity.
The Dickens mode operated in <i>Baron Bean</i>—a
figure half Micawber, half Charlie Chaplin as man
of the world. I have noted, in writing of Chaplin,
Mr Herriman’s acute and sympathetic appreciation
of the first few moments of <i>The Kid</i>. It is only fair
to say here that he had himself done the same thing
in his medium. Baron Bean was always in rags, penniless,
hungry; but he kept his man Grimes, and
Grimes did his dirty work, Grimes was the Baron’s
outlet, and Grimes, faithful retainer, held by bonds
of admiration and respect, helped the Baron in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
one great love affair. Like all of Herriman’s people,
they lived on the enchanted mesa (pronounced: ma-cey)
by Coconino, near the town of Yorba Linda.
The Baron was inventive; lacking the money to
finance the purchase of a postage stamp, he entrusted
a love letter to a carrier pigeon; and his “Go, my
paloma,” on that occasion, is immortal.</p>

<p>Some of these characters are reappearing in Herriman’s
latest work: <i>Stumble Inn</i>. Of this I have
not seen enough to be sure. It is a mixture of fancy
and realism; Mr Stumble himself is the Dickens character
again—the sentimental, endearing innkeeper
who would rather lose his only patron than kill a
favourite turkey cock for Thanksgiving. I have heard
that recently a litter of pups has been found in the
cellar of the inn; so I should judge that fantasy has
won the day. For it is Herriman’s bent to disguise
what he has to say in creations of the animal world
which are neither human nor animal, but each <i>sui
generis</i>.</p>

<p>That is how the Kat started. The thought of a
friendship between a cat and a mouse amused Herriman
and one day he wrote them in as a footnote to
<i>The Family Upstairs</i>. On their first appearance
they played marbles while the family quarreled; and
in the last picture the marble dropped through a hole
in the bottom line. An office boy named Willie was
the first to recognize the strange virtues of <i>Krazy Kat</i>.
As surely as he was the greatest of office boys, so the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
greatest of editors, Arthur Brisbane, was the next to
praise. He urged Herriman to keep the two characters
in action; within a week they began a semi-independent
existence in a strip an inch wide under
the older strip. Slowly they were detached, were
placed at one side, and naturally stepped into the full
character of a strip when the <i>Family</i> departed. In
time the Sundays appeared—three quarters of a page,
involving the whole Krazy Kat and Ignatz families<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
and the flourishing town of Coconino—the flora and
fauna of that enchanted region which Herriman created
out of his memories of the Arizona desert he so
dearly loves.</p>

<p>In one of his most metaphysical pictures Herriman
presents Krazy as saying to Ignatz: “I ain’t a
Kat ... and I ain’t Krazy” (I put dots to indicate
the lunatic shifting of background which goes on
while these remarks are made; although the action is
continuous and the characters motionless, it is in
keeping with Herriman’s method to have the backdrop
in a continual state of agitation; you never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
know when a shrub will become a redwood, or a hut
a church) ... “it’s wot’s behind me that I am ...
it’s the idea behind me, ‘Ignatz’ and that’s wot I am.”
In an attitude of a contortionist Krazy points to the
blank space behind him, and it is there that we must
look for the “Idea.” It is not far to seek. There is
a plot and there is a theme—and considering that
since 1913 or so there have been some three thousand
strips, one may guess that the variations are infinite.
The plot is that Krazy (androgynous, but according
to his creator willing to be either) is in love with
Ignatz Mouse; Ignatz, who is married, but vagrant,
despises the Kat, and his one joy in life is to “Krease
that Kat’s bean with a brick” from the brickyard of
Kolin Kelly. The fatuous Kat (Stark Young has
found the perfect word for him: he is crack-brained)
takes the brick, by a logic and a cosmic memory presently
to be explained, as a symbol of love; he cannot,
therefore, appreciate the efforts of Offisa B. Pupp
to guard him and to entrammel the activities of Ignatz
Mouse (or better, Mice). A deadly war is
waged between Ignatz and Offisa Pupp—the latter is
himself romantically in love with Krazy; and one
often sees pictures in which Krazy and Ignatz conspire
together to outwit the officer, both wanting the
same thing, but with motives all at cross-purposes.
This is the major plot; it is clear that the brick has
little to do with the violent endings of other strips,
for it is surcharged with emotions. It frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
comes not at the end, but at the beginning of an action;
sometimes it does not arrive. It is a symbol.</p>

<p>The theme is greater than the plot. John Alden
Carpenter has pointed out in the brilliant little foreword<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
to his ballet, that Krazy Kat is a combination
of Parsifal and Don Quixote, the perfect fool and
the perfect knight. Ignatz is Sancho Panza and, I
should say, Lucifer. He loathes the sentimental excursions,
the philosophic ramblings of Krazy; he interrupts
with a well-directed brick the romantic excesses
of his companion. For example: Krazy blindfolded
and with the scales of Justice in his hand declares:
“Things is all out of perpotion, ‘Ignatz.’”
“In what way, fool?” enquires the Mice as the scene
shifts to the edge of a pool in the middle of the desert.
“In the way of ‘ocean’ for a instinct.” “Well?”
asks Ignatz. They are plunging head down into mid-sea,
and only their hind legs, tails, and words are
visible: “The ocean is so innikwilly distribitted.”
They appear, each prone on a mountain peak, above
the clouds, and the Kat says casually across the chasm
to Ignatz: “Take ‘Denva, Kollorado’ and ‘Tulsa,
Okrahoma’ they ain’t got no ocean a tall—” (they
are tossed by a vast sea, together in a packing-case)
“while Sem Frencisco, Kellafornia, and Bostin, Messachoosit,
has got more ocean than they can possibly
use”—whereon Ignatz properly distributes a brick
evenly on Krazy’s noodle. Ignatz “has no time” for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
foolishness; he is a realist and Sees Things as They
ARE. “I don’t believe in Santa Claus,” says he;
“I’m too broad-minded and advanced for such nonsense.”</p>

<p>But Mr Herriman, who is a great ironist, understands
pity. It is the destiny of Ignatz never to
know what his brick means to Krazy. He does not
enter into the racial memories of the Kat which go
back to the days of Cleopatra, of the Bubastes, when
Kats were held sacred. Then, on a beautiful day, a
mouse fell in love with Krazy, the beautiful daughter
of Kleopatra Kat; bashful, advised by a soothsayer
to write his love, he carved a declaration on a brick
and, tossing the “missive,” was accepted, although
he had nearly killed the Kat. “When the Egyptian
day is done it has become the Romeonian custom to
crease his lady’s bean with a brick laden with tender
sentiments ... through the tide of dusty years” ...
the tradition continues. But only Krazy knows this.
So at the end it is the incurable romanticist, the victim
of acute Bovaryisme, who triumphs; for Krazy
faints daily in full possession of his illusion, and
Ignatz, stupidly hurling his brick, thinking to injure,
fosters the illusion and keeps Krazy “heppy.”</p>

<p>Not always, to be sure. Recently we beheld
Krazy smoking an “eligint Hawanna cigar” and
sighing for Ignatz; the smoke screen he produced hid
him from view when Ignatz passed, and before the
Mice could turn back, Krazy had handed over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
cigar to Offisa Pupp and departed, saying “Looking
at ‘Offisa Pupp’ smoke himself up like a chimly is
werra werra intrisking, but it is more wital that I find
‘Ignatz’”—wherefore Ignatz, thinking the smoke
screen a ruse, hurls his brick, blacks the officer’s eye,
and is promptly chased by the limb of the law. Up
to this point you have the usual technique of the
comic strip, as old as Shakespeare. But note the final
picture of Krazy beholding the pursuit, himself disconsolate,
unbricked, alone, muttering: “Ah, there him
is—playing tag with ‘Offisa Pupp’—just like the
boom compenions wot they is.” It is this touch of
irony and pity which transforms all of Herriman’s
work, which relates it, for all that the material is preposterous,
to something profoundly true and moving.
It isn’t possible to retell these pictures; but that is
the only way, until they are collected and published,
that I can give the impression of Herriman’s gentle
irony, of his understanding of tragedy, of the <i>sancta
simplicitas</i>, the innocent loveliness in the heart of
a creature more like Pan than any other creation of
our time.</p>

<p>Given the general theme, the variations are innumerable,
the ingenuity never flags. I use haphazard
examples from 1918 to 1923, for though the Kat
has changed somewhat since the days when he was
even occasionally feline, the essence is the same.
Like Charlot, he was always living in a world of his
own, and subjecting the commonplaces of actual life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
to the test of his higher logic. Does Ignatz say that
“the bird is on the wing,” Krazy suspects an error and
after a careful scrutiny of bird life says that “from
rissint obserwation I should say that the wing is on
the bird.” Or Ignatz observes that Don Kiyote is
still running. Wrong, says the magnificent Kat:
“he is either still or either running, but not both still
and both running.” Ignatz passes with a bag containing,
he says, bird-seed. “Not that I doubt your
word, Ignatz,” says Krazy, “but could I give a look?”
And he is astonished to find that it is bird-seed, after
all, for he had all the time been thinking that birds
grew from eggs. It is Ignatz who is impressed by a
falling star; for Krazy “them that don’t fall” are
the miracle. I recommend Krazy to Mr Chesterton,
who, in his best moments, will understand. His mind
is occupied with eternal oddities, with simple things
to which his nature leaves him unreconciled. See
him entering a bank and loftily writing a check for
thirty million dollars. “You haven’t that much
money in the bank,” says the cashier. “I know it,”
replies Krazy; “have you?” There is a drastic simplicity
about Krazy’s movements; he is childlike, regarding
with grave eyes the efforts of older people to
be solemn, to pretend that things are what they seem;
and like children he frightens us because none of our
pretensions escapes him. A king to him is a “royal
cootie.” “Golla,” says he, “I always had a ida they
was grend, and megnifishint, and wondafil, and mejestic ... but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
my goodniss! It ain’t so.” He
should be given to the <i>enfant terrible</i> of Hans Andersen
who knew the truth about kings.</p>

<p>He is, of course, blinded by love. Wandering
alone in springtime, he suffers the sight of all things
pairing off; the solitude of a lonesome pine worries
him and when he finds a second lonesome pine he
comes in the dead of night and transplants one to the
side of the other, “so that in due course, Nature has
her way.” But there are moments when the fierce
pang of an unrequited passion dies down. “In these
blissfil hours my soul will know no strife,” he confides
to Mr Bum Bill Bee, who, while the conversation
goes on, catches sight of Ignatz with a brick, flies
off, stings Ignatz from the field, and returns to hear:
“In my Kosmis there will be no feeva of discord
... all my immotions will function in hominy and
kind feelings.” Or we see him at peace with Ignatz
himself. He has bought a pair of spectacles, and
seeing that Ignatz has none, cuts them in two, so that
each may have a monocle. He is gentle, and gentlemanly,
and dear; and these divagations of his are
among his loveliest moments; for when irony plays
about him he is as helpless—as we are.</p>

<p>To put such a character into music was a fine
thought, but Mr Carpenter must have known that
he was foredoomed to failure. It was a notable effort,
for no other of our composers had seen the possibilities;
most, I fear, did not care to “lower themselves”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
by the association. Mr Carpenter caught
much of the fantasy; it was exactly right for him to
make the opening a parody—The Afternoon Nap of
a Faun. The “Class A Fit,” the Katnip Blues were
also good. (There exists a Sunday Krazy of this
very scene—it is 1919, I think, and shows hundreds
of Krazy Kats in a wild abandoned revel in the
Katnip field—a rout, a bacchanale, a satyr-dance,
an erotic festival, with our own Krazy playing the
viola in the corner, and Ignatz, who has been drinking,
going to sign the pledge.) Mr Carpenter almost
missed one essential thing: the ecstasy of Krazy when
the brick arrives at the end; certainly, as Mr Bolm
danced it one felt only the triumph of Ignatz, one did
not feel the grand leaping up of Krazy’s heart, the
fulfilment of desire, as the brick fell upon him. The
irony was missing. And it was a mistake for Bolm
to try it, since it isn’t Russian ballet Krazy requires;
it is American dance. One man, one man only can
do it right, and I publicly appeal to him to absent
him from felicity awhile, and though he do it but
once, though but a small number of people may see
it, to pay tribute to his one compeer in America, to
the one creation equalling his own—I mean, of course,
Charlie Chaplin. He has been urged to do many
things hostile to his nature; here is one thing he is
destined to do. Until then the ballet ought to have
Johnny and Ray Dooley for its creators. And I hope
that Mr Carpenter hasn’t driven other composers off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the subject. There is enough there for Irving Berlin
and Deems Taylor to take up. Why don’t they?
The music it requires is a jazzed tenderness—as Mr
Carpenter knew. In their various ways Berlin and
Taylor could accomplish it.</p>

<p>They may not be able to write profoundly in the
private idiom of Krazy. I have preserved his spelling
and the quotations have given some sense of his
style. The accent is partly Dickens and partly Yiddish—and
the rest is not to be identified, for it is
Krazy. It was odd that in <i>Vanity Fair’s</i> notorious
“rankings,” Krazy tied with Doctor Johnson, to whom
he owes much of his vocabulary. There is a real sense
of the colour of words and a high imagination in
such passages as “the echoing cliffs of Kaibito” and
“on the north side of ‘wild-cat peak’ the ‘snow squaws’
shake their winter blankets and bring forth a chill
which rides the wind with goad and spur, hurling
with an icy hand rime, and frost upon a dreamy
land musing in the lap of Spring”; and there is the
rhythm of wonder and excitement in “Ooy, ‘Ignatz’
it’s awfil; he’s got his legs cut off above his elbows,
and he’s wearing shoes, and he’s standing on top of
the water.”</p>

<p>Nor, even with Mr Herriman’s help, will a ballet
get quite the sense of his shifting backgrounds.
He is alone in his freedom of movement; in his large
pictures and small, the scene changes at will—it is
actually our one work in the expressionistic mode.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
While Krazy and Ignatz talk they move from mountain
to sea; or a tree stunted and flattened with odd
ornaments of spots or design, grows suddenly long
and thin; or a house changes into a church. The
trees in this enchanted mesa are almost always set
in flower pots with Coptic and Egyptian designs in
the foliage as often as on the pot. There are adobe
walls, fantastic cactus plants, strange fungus and
growths. And they <i>compose designs</i>. For whether
he be a primitive or an expressionist, Herriman is an
artist; his works are built up; there is a definite relation
between his theme and his structure, and between
his lines, masses, and his page. His masterpieces in
colour show a new delight, for he is as naïve and
as assured with colour as with line or black and
white. The little figure of Krazy built around the
navel, is amazingly adaptable, and Herriman economically
makes him express all the emotions with
a turn of the hand, a bending of that extraordinary
starched bow he wears round the neck, or with a twist
of his tail.</p>

<p>And he has had much to express for he has suffered
much. I return to the vast enterprises of the
Sunday pictures. There is one constructed entirely
on the bias. Ignatz orders Krazy to push a huge rock
off its base, then to follow it downhill. Down they
go, crashing through houses, uprooting trees, tearing
tunnels through mountains, the bowlder first, Krazy
so intently after that he nearly crashes into it when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
it stops. He toils painfully back uphill. “Did it
gather any moss?” asks Ignatz. “No.” “That’s
what I thought.” “L’il fillossiffa,” comments Krazy,
“always he seeks the truth, and always he finds it.”
There is the great day in which Krazy hears a lecture
on the ectoplasm, how “it soars out into the limitless
ether, to roam willy-nilly, unleashed, unfettered, and
unbound” which becomes for him: “Just imegine
having your ‘ectospasm’ running around, William
and Nilliam, among the unlimitliss etha—golla, it’s
imbillivibil—” until a toy balloon, which looks like
Ignatz precipitates a heroic gesture and a tragedy.
And there is the greatest of all, the epic, the Odyssean
wanderings of the door:</p>

<p>Krazy beholds a dormouse, a little mouse with a
huge door. It impresses him as being terrible that
“a mice so small, so dellikit” should carry around a
door so heavy with weight. (At this point their
Odyssey begins; they use the door to cross a chasm.)
“A door is so useless without a house is hitched to it.”
(It changes into a raft and they go down stream.)
“It has no ikkinomikil value.” (They dine off the
door.) “It lecks the werra werra essentials of helpfilniss.”
(It shelters them from a hailstorm.) “Historically
it is all wrong and misleading.” (It fends
the lightning.) “As a thing of beauty it fails in
every rispeck.” (It shelters them from the sun and
while Krazy goes on to deliver a lecture: “You never
see Mr Steve Door, or Mr Torra Door, or Mr Kuspa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Door doing it, do you?” and “Can you imagine my
li’l friends Ignatz Mice boddering himself with a
door?”) his li’l friend Ignatz has appeared with the
brick; unseen by Krazy he hurls it; it is intercepted
by the door, rebounds, and strikes Ignatz down.
Krazy continues his adwice until the dormouse sheers
off, and then Krazy sits down to “concentrate his
mind on Ignatz and wonda where he is at.”</p>

<p>Such is our Krazy. Such is the work which America
can pride itself on having produced, and can
hastily set about to appreciate. It is rich with something
we have too little of—fantasy. It is wise with
pitying irony; it has delicacy, sensitiveness, and an
unearthly beauty. The strange, unnerving, distorted
trees, the language inhuman, un-animal, the events
so logical, so wild, are all magic carpets and faery
foam—all charged with unreality. Through them
wanders Krazy, the most tender and the most foolish
of creatures, a gentle monster of our new mythology.</p>

TWO-A-DAY</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> narrator of the following episode is Mr
Percy Hammond of the New York <i>Tribune</i>; the
stars are Montgomery and Stone; the Mr Mansfield
is Richard himself again, the actor who played <i>Dr
Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> better than Thomas E. Shea
did:</p>

<p>“As the stars appeared in the last act in evening
dress, Mr Mansfield turned to me and with venomous
indignation said, ‘That is damned effrontery!’
It seemed to be Mr Mansfield’s belief that mere dancers
had no right to wear the vestments of refined
society.”</p>

<p>To me that is a very funny story and the humour
of it has nothing to do with upon what meat
has this our Cæsar fed that he is grown so great.
The eminence of Mansfield and the worthlessness of
Montgomery and Stone may be assumed; the recrudescence
of the mediæval attitude toward strolling
players, even if it be in the mind of another
player, is also conceivable; snobbism is always conceivable
and often interesting. The story is funny
because it so perfectly illustrates the genteel tradition
in America. (I am rather freely applying Mr
Santayana’s phrase, without any effort to do it justice.)
Montgomery and Stone were in revue or extravaganza,
and were therefore outcast; they didn’t
count as Art. Whereas Mr Mansfield played Shakespeare
and high-school girls went to see him, and so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
he was Art. The application to vaudeville is immediate,
because vaudeville is considered on Broadway
as the grave of artistic reputations. An actor of
established prestige <i>may</i> venture into vaudeville; he
usually makes his audience feel exactly how far he
has condescended to appear before them and accept,
even if he doesn’t earn, a salary three times as great
as usual; but the actor in the middle distance very
well knows that if he goes into vaudeville he is digging
his own grave, because there is a stigma attached
to the two-a-day. Vaudeville players, in
short, are not entitled to “the vestments of refined society.”
About every ten years the corrupt desire to
be refined takes hold of vaudeville itself; but it
dies out quickly and vaudeville remains simple and
good.</p>

<p>It is in one of the stages of simple goodness now,
and I propose to discuss it without reference to a
possibly more noble past. I am well acquainted with
the other method, which was founded, I believe, by
Arthur Symons, and beautifully practised by him.
To him we owe the peculiarly attractive attitude of
sentimental reminiscence which, invented or borrowed
by him, has become classic. It leads to excellent
prose at times, and by showing that there was a
golden age even in vaudeville sometimes creates the
suspicion that vaudeville itself need not be all brass.
But the attitude is unsatisfactory because it invokes,
in dealing with the most immediate of the minor arts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
more than a share of the pathos of distance. Vaudeville
is brightly coloured, zestful, with sharp outlines;
and the classic attitude softens and blurs. It
is required of you to name and describe the acts and
numbers of a better day; one <i>must</i> say “music-hall”
or be slain in the passages of the Jordan; in
America a reference to the <i>commedia dell’arte</i> is, as
scientists say, indicated. Yet the time must come
when it is possible to say, “Vaudeville is. Surely it
could never have been worse than this—or for that
matter, never better. Let us regard it as it is.”
The moment must come in the history of general culture
when vaudeville can be taken without comparisons.
That is, it happens, the only way I can take it,
for in my youth I saw little of it and cared less.
I recall a skit called <i>Change Your Act or Go Back
to the Woods</i>; there were Fours and among them
were Cohans; there was, I remember, The Man Who
Made the Shah of Persia Laugh; once I saw an artist
in pantomime. Yet I am not moved to beat my
breast and begin <i>Einst in meinen Jugendjahren</i>.
Nothing I have heard leads me to believe that there
were better days in vaudeville than those which
open benignant and wide over Joe Cook and Fanny
Brice and the Six Brown Brothers, over the two
Briants and Van and Schenck and the four Marxes
and the Rath Brothers and the team of Williams and
Wolfus; over Duffy and Sweeney and Johnny Dooley
and Harry Watson, Jr., as Young Kid Battling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
Dugan, and Messrs Moss and Frye, who ask how high
is up.</p>

<p>I shall arrive in a moment at the question of refined
vaudeville, a thing I dislike intensely; there
is another sort of refinement in vaudeville which demands
respect. It is the refinement of technique.
It seems to me that the unerring taste of Fanny
Brice’s impersonations is at least partly due to, and
has been achieved through, the purely technical mastery
she has developed; I am sure that the vaudeville
stage makes such demands upon its artists that they
are compelled to perfect everything. They have to do
whatever they do swiftly, neatly, without lost motion;
they must touch and leap aside; they dare not
hold an audience more than a few minutes, at least
not with the same stunt; they have to establish an
immediate contact, set a current in motion, and exploit
it to the last possible degree in the shortest
space of time. They have to be always “in the picture,”
for though the vaudeville stage seems to give
them endless freedom and innumerable opportunities,
it holds them to strict account; it permits no
fumbling, and there are no reparable errors. The materials
they use are trivial, yes; but the treatment
must be accurate to a hair’s breadth; the wine they
serve is light, it must fill the goblet to the very brim,
and not a drop must spill over. There is no great
second act to redeem a false entrance; no grand climacteric
to make up for even a moment’s dulness.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
The whole of the material must be subsumed in the
whole of the presentation, every page has to be <i>written</i>,
every scene <i>rendered</i>, every square inch of the
canvas must be <i>painted</i>, not daubed with paint. It
is, of course, obvious, that the responsibility in this
case is exactly that of the major arts. It is at least
tenable that in this case, as in the major arts, the responsibilities
are fulfilled.</p>

<p>And nothing could be more illuminating than the
moments in vaudeville when the tricky and the bogus
appear. I face here willingly the protest of intelligent
men and women who have gone to vaudeville
to see or hear one turn and have sat through some
of the dreariest æsthetic dancing,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> have heard the
most painfully polite vocalism, have witnessed
“drama.” If vaudeville requires half of what I have
said, how do these things get in and get by? Largely
as a concession to debased public taste. Note well
that all the culture elements in vaudeville, the dull
and base and truly vulgar ones, are importations.
The dance appropriate to the vaudeville stage is the
stunt dance; its proper music is ragtime or jazz;
the playlet which belongs to it (witness the success
of <i>A Slice of Life</i>) is burlesque. Yet like every
other popular art in America, vaudeville is required,
by the tradition of gentility, to be cultural; and its
dull defenders often make it their boast that it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
give culture to the masses (the same sort of thing
is heard in connexion with the music played at moving-picture
houses) because among its native acts
appear <i>tableaux vivants</i> out of Landseer or because
a legitimate actor brings to the common herd scraps
and snatches of <i>Les Misérables</i>. The process continues,
regrettably, and extends to the spoiling of
good vaudeville material. It isn’t a loss of anything
precious, except time which could be filled by something
better, when Mr Lou Tellegen struts about on
the variety stage; it is a defamation of something
good in the major line and equally a loss of moments
when the <i>“Affairs of” Anatol</i> are inexpertly and
tastelessly produced “for vaudeville.” But what
shall we say of such a real disaster as the return of
Miss Ethel Levey to vaudeville, still so rich in attraction
that she plays four weeks at the Palace in
New York, wholly spoiled for variety because she
has had a triumph abroad and has become a “great
actress” or is it “an <i>artiste</i>”? There was in Miss
Levey something roughly elemental, something common
and pure; whatever she did had broadness and
sharpness both. Corrupted by her success abroad,
she returns still magnificent, the voice still throbbing,
the form heavy but dominant—yet no longer vaudeville.
She has the grandeur of a star and appears in
full stage with a grand piano and silk-shaded lamps
and draperies and sings <i>All by Myself</i> with shocking
bad sentimental <i>acting</i>, and gets all she can out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
of <i>Love’s Old Sweet Song</i> before the touch of her old
spirit protests—and recites a dramatic monologue entitled
<i>Destiny!</i> Now and again flashes of burlesque
reveal her ancient flavour; but it is an axiom in
vaudeville that you can’t be good in it if you are too
good for it.</p>

  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">Vaudeville.</span> By Charles Demuth</div>
</div>

<p>I omit the people who aren’t, simply, good
enough; there are second-rate people in vaudeville
as in everything else, and first-rate people of <i>its</i>
second order. The part that is pure, I am convinced,
is rarely matched on our other stages. Certainly not
in the legitimate, nor in the serious artistic playhouse
where knowing one’s job perfectly and doing it simply
and unpretentiously are the rarest things in the
world. Revue and musical comedy require and often
attain the pitch of technical accuracy which vaudeville
sets as a standard, and these two forms draw
heavily upon vaudeville for material and stars, whom
they incorporate only in so far as the stars are not
pure variety themselves. They are as much entitled
to the jazz bands as any other stage, but to me a
jazz band is not essentially variety, although it has
a legitimate place there. That is why I reject Mr
Walter Haviland’s ranking of Ted Lewis as one of
the greatest of vaudeville acts, for the great acts in
vaudeville are those which could not be perfectly
appreciated elsewhere. (The æsthetics of the question
have been canvassed in Laokoön, I believe.)
Johnny Dooley, who always breaks up the show in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
musical comedy, is a real vaudeville player, and
Jack Donahue, who was the sole attraction of another
such piece, is always right, his fumbling for
words is inspired, and so is his dancing, and altogether
it is a completely realized act. Among the
most popular of the big-time acts I am left cold by
Van and Schenck, who are perpetually stopping short
of perfection; their songs are funny, but not witty;
their music is current, no more; their rendition is
always near enough right to be passed. The Four
Marx Brothers do better in creating their special
atmosphere of low comedy; the Six Brown Brothers
are at the very top with their saxophones. It is an
independent act, wholly self-contained, not nearly
so appropriate in any other framework, except possibly
a one-ring circus; it is a real variety turn where
a jazz band is only half and half; and in the case
of these performers everything they do is exquisite.</p>

<p>It isn’t possible to describe the acts, nor even to
suggest the distinctive quality of the head-liners.
There are inexplicable things in vaudeville, things
no rational explanation can touch, such as the persistence
of sawing a woman in half, or the terrific
impact of the singing of Belle Baker, who destroys you
with <i>Elie! Elie!</i> Houdini is variety as all magicians
are and all tricksters—the circus side of vaudeville,
to be sure, and the sensational side. Here belong
the acrobats; I have written elsewhere of the Rath<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
Brothers, who alone are in the spirit and tone of
vaudeville, without any intrusion of the circus. At
the present moment nearly everything in vaudeville
which is best has a touch of parody; not infrequently
it burlesques itself. Herbert Williams, of Williams
and Wolfus, exaggerates wholly in the manner of a
clown; his despairing cry for the “spot<i>li-i-i-ght</i>,” his
wail of unhappiness, with his appearance, his gesture,
his shambling walk, make him a figure out of the
<i>commedia dell’arte</i>—one of the few in vaudeville.
Duffy and Sweeney are parodists of their <i>métier</i>;
their whole fun is in their elaborate pretense of not
caring to amuse the audience. Harry Watson, Jr.,
has taken out of burlesque the accentuated form, the
built-up face, the wide and fatuous gesture peculiar
to that type, and in his broken-down prize-fighter has
created a real character with his jumping the rope
“fi’ thousand conseggitiv times” and “tell ’em what
I did to Philadelphia Jack O’Brien.” I am dragged
into a catalogue of names, which I want to avoid;
but I cannot omit the macabre Moving-Man’s Dream
of the Briants, the rustic studies of Chic Sale, the
elaborate burlesque of melodrama by Charles Withers,
and the exceptional mad magician of Frank Van
Hoven. Van Hoven carries farther than anyone else
the appearance of not knowing the audience is to be
amused. He complains in a mutter of the presence
of human beings, individually probably all right,
but <i>en masse</i>...! He leaves the stage and passes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
out of the auditorium, bidding the audience amuse
itself while he’s gone. And his great finale, with
a bowl of goldfish, a handkerchief in a trunk, a table
covered with a cloth, an inflated paper bag, and a revolver
shot—at the sound of which exactly nothing
happens, is the last word in destroying the paraphernalia
of the magician and all his works.</p>

<p>I have committed myself to the statement that Joe
Cook is perfect and am in no mood to withdraw it.
As vaudeville he is perfect; I can see him in no other
<i>milieu</i> because he lacks the gift—not needed in vaudeville,
though useful there—of holding the audience
in his hand. He is liked, not loved; his act is met
with continuous chuckles, smiles, and laughter; seldom
with guffaws. This is not necessarily to his
credit; it means that he does one sort of thing, and
does it extremely well. It happens to be just the
thing for which vaudeville is made. As Ethel Levey
is what most vaudeville players aspire to be, so Cook
is what they ought to be. He is exactly right. Yet
to give the quality of his rightness is difficult. To
recognize it is easier.</p>

<p>He is versatile, but not in the manner of Sylvester
Schaeffer. He is a master of parody and burlesque,
yet not in the fashion of Charles Withers; his delicate
impersonations have an ease and certainty far beyond
the studies of Chic Sale. Essentially what distinguishes
Joe Cook is that he is very wise and
slightly mad, and his madness is not the “dippy” kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
so admirably practised by Frank Van Hoven. It is
structural. Mr Cook’s is probably the longest single
act in vaudeville, and after it is over he saunters
into one or more of the acts that follow his on the
programme, as his fancy takes him.</p>

<p>His own starts as a running parody of old-time
vaudeville, beginning with the musicians coming out
of the pit, through the magician and the player of instruments
to—but no one has ever discovered where
it does go to. For after the card tricks—the ace of
spades is asked for and, as he remarks after five minutes
of agonized fumbling behind his back, the ace
of spades is asked for and practically at a moment’s
notice the ace of spades is produced; and it never is—Mr
Cook finds it necessary to explain to the audience
in one of the most involved pieces of nonsense ever
invented why he will not imitate four Hawaiians
playing the ukulele. After that literally nothing
matters. He might be with Alice in Wonderland or
at a dada ballet or with the terribly logical clowns
of Shakespeare. I think that Chaplin would savour
his humours.</p>

<p>In an art which is hard and bright and tends to
glitter rather than radiate, he has a gleam of poetry;
but he is like the best of poets because there are no
fuzzy edges, no blurred contours; he is exact and his
precision is never cold. He holds conversations of
an imbecile gravity: How are you? How are <i>you</i>?
Fine, how’s yourself? Good. And you? Splendid.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
How’s your uncle? I haven’t got an uncle.
Fine, how is he? He’s fine. How are <i>you</i>? He
is amazingly inventive, creating new stunts, writing
new lines, doing fresh business from week to
week. His little bits are like witty epigrams in
verse, where the thing done and the skill of the
method coincide and pleasing separately please more
by their fusion. His sense of the stage is equalled
by but one man I have ever seen: George M. Cohan.</p>

<p>Had I had any doubts about vaudeville as we
practice it in the United States they would have
been dispelled in the past two years by one great
success and one notable failure: the <i>Chauve-Souris</i>
of Balieff and the show of the Forty-niners. Balieff
seemed for a moment to be destroying B. F. Keith;
here was something certainly vaudeville, with turns
and numbers, appealing to every grade of intelligence;
here were good music, exciting scenery, and
good fun; here were voices caressing the ear and dancers
dazzling the eye; here was a gay burlesque and
a sophisticated <i>conférencier</i>. Now if our native
product were only like that ... (the implication
was, Wouldn’t we just go every day to the nearest
vaudeville house!). Then, to be sure, a reaction.
Put Ed Wynn and Leon Errol and ... I omit the
list—Wynn was almost unanimously chosen as <i>conférencier</i>—and
we could give the Russians at least
a good run for the money—and it <i>was</i> money, loads
of it, much to their surprise. And then, without Ed
Wynn and the list, the attempt; for the Forty-niners
were cheerfully setting out to be a company of Americans
stranded in Russia, giving the Russians to understand
what the folk and popular arts of America
were. Months earlier the thing had been perfectly
done, as a game, in the <i>No-Siree</i>, a wholly amateur
single performance which was without doubt the gayest
evening of the year in New York. (The tribute
is not exactly wrung from me, for friends of mine
were concerned in it; it was the high moment of the
Algonquin Circle and they should have disbanded
the following morning. Since I was not an adherent
of the group, my advice was not asked; I do not know
whether it still exists, has passed to further triumphs,
or has repeated the Forty-niners.) Put on professionally,
high class vaudeville showed all the weaknesses
of the commercial kind, and had a dulness of
its own. The Dance of the Small-town Mayors was
exactly right, but most of the parodies were outdated,
the burlesques were too <i>voulus</i>, the strain too great.
There was lacking that technical proficiency which is
essential to vaudeville, and the adjustment of means
to material was sloppy. One fell back on Balieff and
discovered, as the exoticism wore off, that he too had
his weak points. Sentimental songs in however
beautiful voices, the choreographics of figures come
to life from Copenhagen plate however accurately
the footfall coincided with Anitra’s Dance, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
number of other things suggested that in Russia, too,
refinement could corrupt and stultify. There remained
elements we could not match: we hadn’t encouraged
our legitimate stage sufficiently to be justified
in expecting cubist settings in vaudeville; nor
when we heard American folk music (and its contemporary
form in ragtime) did we so earnestly applaud
as to keep them fresh in variety shows. Balieff
never was “variety,” and we asked of variety that it
be like him; we missed the meaning of Balieff as
surely as we appreciated the fun. For he was a lesson
not to vaudeville, but to us, to those of us who
left vaudeville in the hands of the least cultivated
audiences. We have asked nothing of vaudeville
simply because we haven’t suspected what it had to
give. Yet week after week at the Palace Theatre in
New York there have been bills equal in entertainment
to the average Balieff programme; there has
been evident an expertness in technique, a skill in
construction, a naturalness of execution, a soundness
of sense and judgement, which ought to have appealed
to all who had taste and discrimination. The
people who do go there have something, at least;
and lack snobbism generally. If the audiences of
the Theatre Guild and the Neighborhood Playhouse
were to add themselves to their number, were to
accept what is given and be receptive to something
more, it could not hurt vaudeville. Because like
everything else variety must grow, and there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
reason why it should shut itself off from the direction
of civilized life. It can exist very well without
the Theatre Guild audience; I wonder whether that
audience can exist as well without variety.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THEY CALL IT DANCING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">One</span> of the most tiresome of contemporary intellectual
sentimentalities is the cult of “the dance”—a
cult which has almost nothing in the world to do
with dancing. “The dance” is “art”; dancing is a
form of popular entertainment, one of the very few
which can be practised by its admirers. It is also one
of the arts which can be “polite” without danger of
atrophy, the danger in this case being that the technical
refinement may eventually make dancing a trick,
a rather graceful sort of juggling.</p>

<p>In any case, we shall not have in America anything
corresponding to folk dances; the ritual dance,
the dance as religion, simply isn’t our type, and none
of the tentatives in favour of that kind of dancing
has made me regret our natural bent toward ballroom
and stunt dancing as a mode of expression. In the
rue Lappe in Paris nearly every other house is a
<i>Bal Musette</i> and in all but one of these dance halls
the floor is taken by men and women of that quarter,
working men and women who come in and dance and
pay a few <i>sous</i> for each dance. They do this every
night and enjoy it; they enjoy the sometimes wheezing
accordeon and the bells which, on the right ankle
of the player, accentuate the beat. They dance
waltzes and polkas and, since the Java is forbidden,
the mazurka. Once I saw two couples rise and dance
the <i>bourrée</i>, presumably as it was danced in their
native province of Auvergne; it is possible to see
other provincial dances of France, as they are remembered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
in the Bal Musette of this district and
elsewhere—occasionally and not by pre-arrangement.
The ancient dances of America haven’t such roots,
nor such vitality; and we may have to become much
more simple, or much more sophisticated, before we
will proceed naturally to buck-and-wing and cakewalk
and the ordinary breakdown on the floor of the
Palais Royal. There are Kentucky mountain and
cowboy dances which the moving picture inadequately
reconstructs, and I am afraid that even
negro levee dancing has lost much of its own character
in the process of influencing the steps of the ordinary
American dance. Undoubtedly those who can
should preserve these provincial and rooted dances;
but it is idle to pretend that dancing itself can be
a subject for archæology. It is essentially for action,
not for speculation.</p>

<p>I do not belittle dancing when I attempt to deprive
it of the cachet of “Art.” Nothing so precise,
so graceful, so implicated with music, can escape being
artistic; in the hands of its masters it becomes an
intuitive creative process, but this happens most
frequently when the dancer gives himself to the music
and seldom when he tries to interpret the music.
From the waltz to the tango, from the tango to the
current fox-trot or one-step, polite dancing has held
more of what is essentially artistic than the art-dance,
and it has had no pretensions. The old tango and the
maxixe were the only ones which could not easily be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
danced by those who applauded them on the stage;
classic dancing, on the contrary, has always been an
art of professionals—almost a contradiction in terms
in this case, for it is the essence of the dance that it
can be danced. It is not the essence of the dance that
it can be staged, or made into a pantomime. The
Russian Ballet has no reference to the subject for it
is essentially the work of mimes and the dancing is
either folk dance or choreography.</p>

<div id="i_268" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img src="images/i_268.jpg" width="1198" height="1550" alt="" />
  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">Irene Castle</span></div>
</div>

<p>The reason politeness is not fatal to the dance is
that there is only one standard of vulgarity in dancing,
which is ugliness. Vulgarity means actively disagreeable
postures and steps not exceptionally
adapted to the music. The relation of the dancers to
one another is the basis of their relation to the music,
and that is why the shimmy has little to do with
dancing, whereas the cheek-to-cheek position—the
<i>bête-noire</i> of chaperons a few weeks, or is it years,
ago?—is fundamentally not objectionable, since it
brings two dancers to as near a unit, with the same
centre of gravity, as the dance requires. One doesn’t
dance the fox-trot as one danced the Virginia reel,
and the question of morals has little to do with the
case. The “indecencies” of the turkey-trot, as we
used to phrase it, disappeared not because we are
better men and women, but because we are dancing
more beautifully.</p>

<p>Two influences have worked to accomplish this.
One is that our music has become more interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
and is written specifically to be danced, as the waltz-song
always was and as our older ragtime was not.
The other is the effect of the stage (through which
we have, recently, learned a vast amount from negro
dancing, an active influence for the last fifteen years
at least, touching the dance at every point in music,
and tending always to prevent the American dance
from becoming cold and formal.) Dancing masters
go to the stage to perform the dances they have elaborated
in their studios; from the stage the dance is
adapted to the floor. This is what makes it so unnerving
to go through a year seeing nothing but men
jumping over their own ankles, or to witness Carl
Randall dancing himself into his evening clothes.
One doesn’t know how soon one will be called upon
to do the same sort of thing in the semi-privacy of
the night club. Acrobatic dancing is interesting as
all acrobatics are—brutally for the stunt and æsthetically
for the picture formed while doing the trick.
The dancing of choruses has something of the same
interest. The Tiller or Palace Girls do very little
that would merit attention if done by one of them;
done by sixteen, it is entertaining; so are the ranks
of heads appearing over the top step of the Hippodrome
or at the New Amsterdam, and the ranks of
knees rhythmically bending as row follows row down
the stairs. But none of these affect actual dancing
appreciably.</p>

<p>Acrobatic or stunt dancing has a tendency to corrupt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
good exhibition dancing—the desire to do something
obviously difficult displaces the more estimable
desire to do something beautiful. Yet some of our
best stunt dancers can and do combine all the elements
and to watch them is to experience a double
delight. George M. Cohan always danced interestingly;
he has sardonic legs and he is, I suppose, the
repository of all the knowledge we have of the 1890–1910
dance. Frisco took up the same work near the
place where Cohan dropped it; he is (but where I
do not know) a character dancer with a specific sense
of jazz, and was, for a moment, the symbolic figure
of what was coming. His eccentricities were premature,
his comparative disappearance unmerited. Eccentric
also, and not chiefly dancers, are Leon Errol
and Jimmy Barton. Eccentric and essentially a
dancer is the fine comic Johnny Dooley. The difference
is that almost all of Dooley’s comedy is <i>in</i> his
dancing, whereas the others are great comedians and
their dances are also funny. It seems to be Dooley’s
natural mode to walk on the side of his feet and to
catch a broken, wholly American rhythm in every
movement—to create dances, therefore, which are
untouched by the Russian Ballet and other trepaks
and hazzazzas. The foreign influence has touched
Carl Randall, a gain in expertness, a loss in freshness.
There seems to be nothing he cannot do, nothing
he doesn’t do well, nothing he does superbly.</p>

<p>The dancing team which ought to have been the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
best of our time and wasn’t is that of Julia Sanderson
and Donald Brian.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The suppleness of Miss
Sanderson’s body, the breathless sway of the torso on
the hips, the suggestion of languor in the most rapid
of her movements, are not to be equalled; and Brian
was always smart, decisive, accurate. It is difficult
to define the defect which was always in their work;
probably a reserve, a not giving themselves away to
the music, a shade too much of the stiffness which
dancing requires. Miss Sanderson gets along quite
well without the lyric knees (as they were—one
doesn’t see them now) of Ann Pennington; nor has
she the exceptional height which makes the grace of
Jessica Brown so surprising and her curve of beauty
so exceptional. Miss Brown, I take it, is one of the
best dancers of the stage, and, unlike Charlotte
Greenwood, has nothing to do with grotesque. Miss
Greenwood makes a virtue of her defect—the longest
limbs in the world. Miss Brown is unconscious of
hers as defects at all; like most people’s, her legs are
long enough to reach the ground. It is marvellous
to see what she can do when she lifts them off the
ground.</p>

<p>I choose these names as examples, fully aware
that I may be omitting others equally famous. But
what remains is deliberate: two groups of dancers
who were at the very top, I think, of their profession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
of their art. Of Doyle and Dixon only Harland
Dixon is now visible; the team is broken, but
Dixon continues to be a wonderful dancer, in the
tradition rather of Fred Stone, and with recent leanings
toward acting. It was 1915 or so when I saw
them dance Irving Berlin’s <i>Ragtime Melodrama</i>, and
although I have never seen that equalled, I have
never seen the team or Dixon alone dance anything
unworthy of that piece. It was a beautiful duo, perfectly
cadenced, creating long grateful lines around
the stage; it was full of tricks and fun and character.
And gradually the duo resolved itself into feats
of individual prowess, in which Dixon slowly surpassed
his partner and became a miracle of acrobatics
in rhythm. He is agile, never jerky, with a nice
sense of syncopation; he requires Berlin rather than
Kern for his full value.</p>

<p>Kern gives all (and more) that Maurice can require,
and whether with Florence Walton or Leonora
Hughes the dancing of Maurice is always icily regular,
and nearly null. His type of mechanism is exactly
wrong and he sets off in bold relief the accuracy,
the inspired rightness of Irene and Vernon
Castle. That these two, years ago, determined the
course dancing should take is incontestable. They
were decisive characters, like Boileau in French
poetry and Berlin in ragtime; for they understood,
absorbed, and transformed everything known of
dancing up to that time and out of it made something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
beautiful and new. Vernon Castle, it is possible,
was the better dancer of the two; in addition to the
beauty of his dancing he had inventiveness, he anticipated
things of 1923 with his rigid body and his
evolutions on his heel; but if he were the greater,
his finest creation was Irene.</p>

<p>No one else has ever given exactly that sense of
being freely perfect, of moving without effort and
without will, in more than accord, in absolute identity
with music. There was always something unimpassioned,
cool not cold, in her abandon; it was certainly
the least sensual dancing in the world; the
whole appeal was visual. It was as if the eye following
her graceful motion across a stage was gratified
by its own orbit, and found a sensuous pleasure in
the ease of her line, in the disembodied lightness
of her footfall, in the careless slope of her lovely
shoulders. It was not—it seemed not to be—intelligent
dancing; however trained, it was still intuitive.
She danced from her shoulders down, the straight
scapular supports of her head were at the same time
the balances on which her exquisitely poised body
depended. There were no steps, no tricks, no stunts.
There was only dancing, and it was all that one
ever dreamed of flight, with wings poised, and
swooping gently down to rest. I put it in the past,
I hardly know why; unless because it is too good to
last.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> most sophisticated of the minor arts in America
is that of the colyumist. It is, except for occasional
lapses into the usual journalistic disrespect for
privacy, a decent art, and if it never rises to the polish
and wit of such an outstanding colyumist as La-Fourchardière
of <i>l’Œuvre</i>, it never sinks to the pretentious
pseudo-intelligent vulgarity of the English
counterpart. The colyumist is, to begin with, a
newspaper humorist, and there are times, when questions
of art and letters are discussed, when one wishes
he had remained one. Phillips, who is now with the
<i>Sun and Globe</i> in New York, sticks to his game manfully;
he tells nothing about himself, discusses no
plays, and his colyum, which he illustrates with grotesque
little drawings, is self-contained. You do
not have to be in the secret to read him. His usual
manner is to take a notable or obscure item of news
and play with it, in the manner of Mark Twain.
When Ambassador Harvey made a speech on the
topic, “Have Women Souls”? Phillips reported the
proceedings and the aftermath:</p>

<p>“Latest bulletins from Europe and Asia on the
conduct of other American diplomats follow:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="in0">
“Warren G. Harding,<br />
<span class="in1">President, United States:</span><br />
Excellency:—
</p>

<p>American ambassador here has brought about grave crisis by
speech, “Are Bananas a Fruit or a Flower?” and “Can Fresh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
Roasted Peanuts Think?” Understand he has stated publicly
his opinion that John McCormack is greater singer than Caruso.
People are near uprising. Will you recall him or shall
we give him the bum’s rush?</p>

<p class="sigright">KING OF ITALY.</p>
</div>

<p class="in0">and so on.</p>

<p>It is horseplay; but when he is in form it achieves
a wild carelessness and gaiety which the intellectual
colyumist entirely forswears. He has for compeer
Arthur “Bugs” Baer, by all odds the funniest of the
colyumists and a too-much-neglected creator of
American humour. There is, also, a considerable
number of colyumists of the Phillips type in other
cities. I make no apology for not knowing them,
for a colyum correctly conceived is written for the
readers of its paper. It ought to be partly private,
and wholly provincial. Even Mencken when he ran
the colyum of the Baltimore <i>Sun</i>, and gathered much
material for <i>The American Language</i>, and told of
each new consignment of German beer after the
blockade began in 1915, even he was not all things
to all men.</p>

<p>The last man who kept his colyum balanced between
the high and low comic touch was Bert Leston
Taylor. He was a very wise and humane person,
wise and humane enough to appreciate and to publish
fun of a sort differing by much from the humour
he created. There was something unnervingly oblique
in his vision of the world, perfectly illustrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
by the captions he wrote for clippings from rustic
journals. He would take an item, “Our popular
telegraphist Frank Dane had a son presented to him
last week. Frank says he is going to stay home nights
hereafter,” and write over it, “How the Days Are
Drawing In.” There was nothing incongruous in
the appearance side by side of his own expert parodies
and the horseplay humour of some of his contributors.
Taylor’s touch made everything light, everything
right. In his house there were indeed many
mansions. After him—before his death even—the
colyumists divided and went separate ways. The
Chicago <i>Tribune</i> continues the Field-Taylor tradition
indifferently well. Riq of the Chicago <i>Evening
Post</i> comes near the golden mean, but his own character
as a colyumist is jeopardized by his contributors;
when he gets a good theme—such as the necessity
for keeping the seam of a stocking straight,
he can be counted on. Calverley indicated his difficulty—or
almost: Themes are so scarce in this world
of ours.</p>

<p>The colyumists are sophisticated, or <i>faux-naïfs</i>,
or actually <i>naïf</i>. Of the first, F. P. A. of the New
York <i>World</i> is the most notable and Baird Leonard
of the <i>Morning Telegraph</i> the best. F. P. A. has
all the virtues of the colyumist in the highest degree;
unfortunately he has almost all the faults, in
nearly the same measure. He is a defeated Calverley,
writing the best light verse in America, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
best parodies in verse. His Persicos Odi, one of
several (published in the quarterly “1910”), seems
to me better than Field’s—which had the lines, “And
as for roses, Holy Moses, they can’t be got at living
prices.” Adams’, as I recall it, ran:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The pomp of the Persian I hold in aversion;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I hate all their gingerbread tricks;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Their garlicky wreathings and lindeny tree-things</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nix.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Boy, us for plain myrtle while under this fertile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Old grapevine myself I protrude</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For your old bibacious Quintus Horatius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stewed.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and his treatment of the same poem according to
Service is perfect parody. Algernon St. John
Brenon used to quarrel magisterially with Adams
about Latin quantities, but he could never undermine
Adams’ feeling for the ease and urbanity of Horace—and
Adams isn’t in the business of preserving the
tradition of dignity.</p>

<p>His trick verse is not exceptional; he has no Dobsonian
feeling for form; in prose parody he is a
duffer. His own prose has the one essential quality
for wit—it is not diffuse.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> His actual character is that
of a civilized man who cannot be imposed upon by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
the bunk, and as he is fairly independent he recognizes
fake—in the world of politics, business, and
society—wherever it occurs. This is what prevents
him from being a good radical (type: Heywood
Broun; other things in his nature keep him from the
insolence of martyrdom), and what makes his work
sympathetic to mature and disillusioned minds. His
exceptional good sense—he seems to have no sensibility—makes
stupidity an irritation to him; he follows
half of the biblical precept and does not suffer
fools gladly. The habit of pontificating has grown
on him, and from expressing himself with justifiable
arrogance on minor matters he has proceeded to speak
with assurance on manners, art, and letters. It would
be more accurate to say that he speaks without the
humility becoming to one who for many months
boosted W. B. Maxwell in opposition to Joseph
Conrad. He hasn’t, essentially, any idea of his great
influence; for if he knew that a vast number of semi-intelligent
people were guided by him he would not
so rapidly praise and damn (or praise with faint
damns, if I may quote another colyum). He is the
most exasperating of colyumists; and his triviality
when confronted by things he does not understand—I
am thinking of his comment on <i>The Waste Land</i>—is
appalling. Yet this same quality is what makes
him precious; he is a gadfly to an exceptionally sluggish
beast—the New York intellectual. He has, inevitably,
become the patron saint of the smart. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
any rate, he has done something to destroy the tradition
that what is witty is unsound. It is only when
he is serious that he becomes a little ridiculous.</p>

<p>I quarrel as much with Baird Leonard’s judgement
on art and letters, but I am not irritated because
Miss Leonard (who writes for a paper devoted
to horse-racing and the theatre) is almost always willing
to indicate the path by which she arrives at her
discriminations. She hasn’t F. P. A.’s weak fear of
the common, and her own mind is as far removed as
his from the commonplace, it has movements of grace
and lightness, and her humour is smooth and wholly
urban. Too often for me she fills her column with
Bridge Table Talk, a sardonic report of fake intellectualism
done with vigour and ferocity, but hampered
by the framework which is not adaptable. I
do not, at this moment, recall a line she has written;
I recall the tone of her whole work—it is unaffected,
not self-conscious, brightly aware of everything, keen
and curious and always on the alert. If the stage
were what it seems from out in front, Miss Leonard
would be well placed on a theatrical paper. She is
writing for people wise enough to know the place
of wit. Adams, I fear, is beginning to write for people
witty enough (and no more) to despise wisdom.</p>

<p>The creator of an American legend—I quote
from the advertisements—is certainly a wise man.
Don Marquis, who now writes his colyum alone, has
always had a good second-rate talent for verse, and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
good first-rate understanding of humanity. It is the
second quality which makes him appreciate the
memoirs of William Butler Yeats, and helps him
create <i>The Old Soak</i>. “Here’s richness”! It was
right for him to make an entire second act of that
play an ode to hard liquor, with lyric interludes about
the parrot, for he is on the side of humanity, against
the devils and angels alike. Hard liquor, loafing,
decency, are his gods, and he fights grimly, with a
tendency to see the devil in modern art. He is
against a great many American fetiches: efficiency
and Y. M. C. A. morality and getting on; and he has
a strong, persistent sentiment for common and simple
things. All of these together would not make him a
good colyumist without some expressive gift. He has
enough to render his most endearing qualities fully.
And beyond them he has at times a bitterness which
drives him to write like Swift and a fantasy which
creates archie and Captain Fitz-Urse, and these also
are parts of his wisdom.</p>

<p>Christopher Morley, like Rolla (not, however,
Rollo), has come too late into a world too old, and
daily dreams himself back into the time when a gentle
essayist was the noblest man of letters and William
McFee a great novelist. His latest work is bound in
Gissing Blue Leather, is admired by Heywood Broun,
and has been compared to nearly everything except
the Four Gospels. Little children should not be permitted
to read his colyum in the New York <i>Evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Post</i>, for it is a sort of literary <i>boy-scoutisme</i>, and
very wrong! (It has recently ceased to exist.)</p>

<p>The influence of the daily column is so great that
by this time a goodly portion of the literary criticism—or
book-reviewing—appears in that form. Keith
Preston is partly colyumist, partly literary critic,
estimable if not always just in both departments, and
a writer of excellent verse. Of the literary colyumists
Broun is the most interesting case. He has a
peculiar mind, apt to find a trifling detail the clue
to too many great things; he has a great sense for the
pompous and the pretentious; he is actually a
humorist when he lets go. But a strange thing has
happened to him. While he was acquiring a reputation
as arbiter of taste in New York by putting down
his simple feelings about books and other things, he
was slowly becoming aware of the existence of the
intellect. It was borne in upon him, as I believe the
phrase is, that a work of art is the product of an
intellect working upon materials provided by a sensibility.
The discovery unnerved him—I might almost
say deflowered. For Broun has lost his native innocence;
he is a little frightened by the hard young men
who sudden let loose the jargon of æsthetics, of philosophy,
of the intellect in general—and what is
worse, he <i>thinks</i> that they may not be bluffing. He
has gone manfully to work, but the middle distance
is dangerous. It is likely to produce more dicta like
his notorious dismissal of rhythmic prose by a reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
to verse rhythms in prose. His characteristic
statement is, however, apropos of a flying catch by
Aaron Ward, of which, Broun said that no book had
ever so affected him with the sense that the humanly
impossible had been accomplished. He seems to
wonder, now, whether discovering the mind will ever
console him if he loses the catch, whether being an
amiable, intelligent, courageous, radical humorist,
with sufficient taste to dislike the third-rate and a
jocular respect for the first rate—whether all this
isn’t enough. And all the while the young men of
three nations are giving him to believe that the really
new movement is going to be intellectual. In the
moment of hesitation he does one thing which may
save him—slowly renouncing literature, he digs into
his humour and works it hard. He or it will be exhausted
presently; when that happens he will be out
of the woods—on either side.</p>

<p>But I doubt whether Broun ever was as simple
as Bugs Baer. His is called roughneck humour—for
all I care. The truth is that Baer is one of the few
people writing for the newspapers who have a distinct
style. K. C. B. has a form which becomes a
formula—it is exasperating to read it—one continues
as one continues to read the Bull Durham signs along
a railroad track. Baer writes like the speech of Falstaff
and his companions, with a rowdy exaggeration.
His comparisons are far fetched, his conceptions
utterly fantastic. His daily commentaries on sport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
are concise and entertaining, his best work occurs
there,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> but in <i>The Family Album</i>, a Sunday feature
of the Hearst papers, he succeeds, despite the subject
and the length, in communicating his peculiar quality.
It is mingled with banalities like “he was hunting
quail on toast up in Canada,” but you also get:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>So he felt better and met a friend of his and they skipped
the Eighteenth Amendment a couple of times and uncle came
home and challenged pop to anything. Pop wanted to know
what, and uncle said, “Anything at all. There ain’t one thing
that you can do that I can’t do better than you.”</p>

<p>He kept up his anonymous boasting and pop said to mom,
“Your escaped brother is loose again. That’s him. He takes
one drink of that radio liquor and he starts broadcasting.”</p>

<p>Uncle said, “I’ll broadcast you for a row of weather-beaten
canal boats. I’m mad and hungry. I’m as hot and hollow as
a stovepipe.”</p>

<p>Mom said to pop, “Don’t turn Abimelech away hungry.
What does the Good Book say <span class="locked">about—”</span></p>

<p>Pop said, “Oh! That’s been vetoed by the President.”</p>
</div>

<p>There follows what he calls “another quaint tribal
quarrel” in which “pop laughed a whole octave above
sarcastic” and “Mom said, ‘Stop that debate before
I take the negative.’”</p>

<p>Everything of Bugs Baer is foreshortened; he
is elliptical, omits the middle step. His language is
syncopation. His points of reference are all in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
common life; I don’t suppose that he has ever touched
a book or a play in his column. For all that, he impresses
me as a naturally subtle spirit. I may be
wrong. He is certainly a joyful one.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">This</span> is a footnote in the interest of justice more
than anything else. The general scheme of this book
is that it is to be an outline, for each of its major
chapters is devoted to a subject about which a book
ought to be written—but not by me. In such an outline
there is no specified allotment of space, and I
have written most on the lively arts in which I myself
take the liveliest pleasure. Burlesque is not of these—and
I confess to enjoying it most in the person of
those artists who come out of it into revue, or vaudeville,
or any other framework with which I am
familiar and which I admire. I can understand an
enthusiast feeling the same way about them as I feel
about revue and vaudeville players who try to enter
the legitimate stage—that they are corrupted by a
desire to be refined. The great virtues of burlesque
as I (insufficiently) know it are its complete lack of
sentimentality in the treatment of emotion and its
treatment of appearance. The harsh ugliness of the
usual burlesque make-up is interesting—I have seen
sinister, even macabre, figures upon its stage—and
the dancing, which has no social refinement, occasionally
develops angular positions and lines of exciting
effect. I find the better part of burlesque elsewhere,
notably in clowns. And instead of trying to
be fair to a medium I do not know well, nor care too
much about, I have put in a picture which I greatly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
admire and which probably is more to the point than
anything I could write.</p>

<p>I shall try to find a picture for the circus, too. Because
the circus is a mixed matter and some of it is
superb. The <i>jeux icariens</i> I have never seen except
in France: they are really exquisite. They are
usually performed by a whole family. The training
is exceedingly arduous, must be begun in childhood,
and the art is dying out. In this act the essential
thing is the use of human bodies as maniable material.
The small boy I saw rolled himself into a tight round
ball and was caught on the upturned feet of his
father, flat on his back, and tossed to another grownup
in the same position, the little rolled-up body
spinning like a ball through the air. The beauty of
the movements, the accuracy and the finesse of the
exploitation of energy, delighted. Trained elephants,
however, haven’t exactly this quality; and trained
seals, agreeable to watch because they are graceful
and supple of body, lack something. I have seen a
diabolo player who was beautiful to follow, and a
juggler who placed two billiard cues end to end on
his forehead, threw a ball and caught it at the top
of the cues, then dislodged the ball and put it into
play with three others. This extraordinary mixture
of good and dull things, this lack of character, makes
the circus easy to like and useless to think about.
The special atmosphere of the circus, the sounds and
sights, and smells, are, of course, another matter.</p>

<p>Two of its actual features justify speculation:
acrobats and clowns. The American vaudeville
player can say nothing worse of an audience than
“they like the acrobats.” When they hang by their
teeth I cannot respect them; the development of any
part of the human body is interesting, no doubt, and
I do not wish to insist that there <i>must</i> be an æsthetic
interest in every act. But I feel about them as the
Chinese philosopher felt about horse-racing: that it
is a well-established fact that one horse can beat
another, and the proof is superfluous. But there are
trapeze workers whose technique is a joy to see and
who exploit all the possible turns, leaps, somersaults
in air, so that one is pleased and dazzled. I do not
wonder that painters in every age have found them
a lovely subject. But a lady balanced on one leg of
a trapeze bar, smoking a cigarette, fanning herself,
<i>not holding on to anything</i>—means exactly nothing
to me unless it is accomplished with some other quality
than nerve. I am sure she will never fall and do
not care to be present when she does.</p>

<p>Clowns are different. Even those poor nameless
ones who dash in between major acts and with noise
and toy balloons divert little children, have some
quality. They partake of our tradition about masks,
they can’t help having background. Everything exaggerated
and ugly in burlesque is here put to the
uses of laughter; even the dullest has some gaiety in
make-up, in a mechanical contrivance, in gait or gesture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Marceline helping the attendants with Powers’
Elephants at the <i>Hippodrome</i>, so busy, so in the way,
so unconscious of hindering, always created a little
world around himself. Grock is incredible in the
faultlessness of his method; as musical-eccentric he
surpasses all other clowns, and his simple attitude
before chairs and pianos and the other complications
of life is a study in creativeness. I have written elsewhere
of Fortunello and Cirillino, also great clowns;
and they complete this sketchy footnote, since for the
greatest clowns I have ever seen, nothing short of a
separate title will suffice.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="firstword">Clowns</span> are the most traditional of all entertainers
and one of the most persistent of the traditions
about them is that those who have just died
were better than those one has laughed at a moment
ago. A very obvious reason is that the clowns of the
recent past are the clowns of our own childhood. It
is my fortunate position never to have seen a clown
when I was a child, and all those I have ever laughed
at are alive and funny. One of them, the superb
Grock, was a failure in New York; the remarkable
Fortunello and Cirillino who arrived with the <i>Greenwich
Village Follies</i> of 1922 are acrobats of an exceptional
delicacy and humour; there isn’t a touch of
obvious refinement about them and they are exquisite.
And the real thing in knockabout grotesquerie are the
three who call themselves, justifiably, the true and
inimitable kings of laughter, the brothers Fratellini
at the Cirque Medrano in Paris.</p>

<p>The Cirque Medrano is a one-ring circus in a permanent
building near the Place Pigalle; ten times a
week it fills the vast saucer of its seating capacity at
an absurdly low price—the most expensive seats, I
believe, are six francs—and presents something a
little above the average European circus bill. There
are more riding and a few more stunts than at others,
and there are less trained animals. And ten times
weekly the entire audience shouts with gratification
as Francesco Fratellini steps gracefully over the ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
hesitates, retreats, and finally sits
down in a ringside seat and begins
a conversation with the lady sitting
beside him.</p>

<p>The thing which distinguishes
the Fratellini and makes them
great is a sort of internal logic in
everything they do. When the
spangled figure with the white-washed
face sits down by the ring
and chats a moment it is merely
disconcerting; at once the logic
appears—he is waiting for the show to begin. An
attendant approaches and tells him to stop stalling,
that the people are waiting to be amused. He replies
in an odd English that he has paid his “mawney” and
why doesn’t the show begin. Promptly another attendant
repeats the message of
the first in English; Francesco replies
in Italian. By the time the
process has been gone through in
five languages the clown has
changed his tack entirely; you
realize that since he doesn’t understand
what all these uniformed
attendants are saying to him, he
thinks that <i>they</i> are the show and
he is trying to conceal his own irritation
at being made the object<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
of their addresses and at the same time he is pretending
to be amused at their antics. The last time he speaks
in what seems to be gibberish (it is credibly reported
to be rather fair Turkish) and the attendants fall back.
From the opposite entrance to the ring arrives a figure
of unparalleled grotesqueness—garments
vast and loose in unexpected
places, monstrous shoes,
squares like windowpanes over
his eyes, a glowing and preposterous
nose. His gait is of the
utmost dignity, he senses the situation
and advances to Francesco’s
seat; and as a pure matter
of business he delivers a terrific
slap, bows nobly, and departs.
Francesco enters the ring. At
the same time a third figure appears—a bald-headed
man in carefully arranged clothes, a monocle, and a
high hat, a stick. The three Fratellini are on the
scene.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Alberto</span></div></div>

<p>It is impossible to say what happens there, for the
Fratellini have an inexhaustible repertoire. The
materials are always of the simplest, and the effects,
too; they have hardly any “props,” the costumes, the
smiles, the movements, the gestures, are almost exactly
alike from day to day. Much of their material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
is old, for they are the sons and grandsons of clowns
as far back as their family memory can carry; I have
seen them once appear armed for a fight with inflated
bladders, looking precisely like contemporary pictures
in Maurice Sand’s book about the <i>commedia dell’arte</i>,
and on another occasion have seen them so carried
away with the frenzy of their activity that they actually
improvised and proved their descent from this
ancient form. They do burlesque sketches—a barber
shop, a bull fight, a human elephant, a magician, or a
billiard game; the moment they stop the entire audience
roars for “la musique,” the most famous of their
acts, remarkable because it has a minimum of physical
violence.</p>

<p><i>La Musique</i> is all a matter of construction and is
a wonderful example of the use of material. For at
bottom it consists of the efforts of two men to play a
serenade and the continual intrusion of a third.
Francesco and Paolo arrive, each carrying a guitar or
a mandoline, and place two chairs close together exactly
in the centre of the ring. They step on the
chairs and prepare to sit on the backs, but even this
simple process is difficult for them, as neither is willing
to sit down before the other, nor to remain seated
while the other is still erect, and they must be continually
rising and apologizing until one flings the
other down and keeps him there until he himself is
seated. Ready then, they blow out the electric lights
and strike the first notes; but the spotlight deserts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
them; they are left in the dark and puzzled; they
regard one another with dismay and suspicion. Suddenly
they see it across the ring and, descending with
great gravity, carry their chairs across. Again they
start, and again the spotlight goes; their irritation
mounts, but their dignity remains and they follow it.
It flits back to where they had come from. There is a
consultation and the two chairs are returned to their
original place in the centre of the ring. Then the
two musicians take off their coats, prowl around the
ring stalking the light, and fall upon it; then slowly
and with much labour they lift the light by its edges
and carefully carry it back to their chairs. And as
they begin to play the grotesque marches in behind
them, unconscious of them, intent only upon his vast
horn and the enormous musical score he carries. Unseeing
and unseen, he prepares himself, and at about
the tenth bar the great bray of his horn shatters the
melody of the strings. The two musicians are dismayed,
but as they cannot see the source of the disturbance,
they try again; again the horn intrudes.
This time there is expostulation and argument with
the grotesque, but, as he reasonably points out, music
was desired and he is doing his share. There is only
one issue for such a scene, and it takes place, in a riot.</p>

<div id="i_300" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31em;">
  <img src="images/i_300.png" width="2417" height="2653" alt="" />
  <div class="captionr"><span class="smcap">The Fratellini.</span> By Fernand Leger</div></div>

<p>The preparation of these riots is a work of real
delicacy, for the Fratellini know that two things are
equally true: violence is funny and violence ceases
to be funny. Like Chaplin, they infuse into their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
violence the sense of reason—they are violent only
when no other means will suffice. In the photographer
scene they call into action the “august” a stock
character of the European circus, played at the
Medrano with exceptional skill by M Lucien Godart.
The august is a man of great dignity whose office it
is to parley with clowns, be the butt of their jokes,
and in M Godart’s version, set off their grotesque
appearance by an excellent figure and the most correct
of evening clothes. (He is in addition a rather good
tumbler, and it is part of the Medrano tradition for
the audience to hiss him until he grows seemingly
furious and turns twenty difficult somersaults around
the ring.) The Fratellini, armed with a huge black
box and a cloth, ask him to sit for his photograph.
Francesco takes it upon himself to explain the apparatus,
Paolo standing close by with the three fence
posts which represent the tripod, and Alberto, the
grotesque waiting near by. Suddenly the tripod falls
on Alberto’s feet and he howls with pain; Paolo picks
the posts up again, and again they fall, and again he
howls. It is unbelievable that this should be funny,
yet it is funny beyond any capacity to describe it for
one reason which the spectator senses long before he
sees it. That is that the tripod is not intentionally
thrown on the feet of the grotesque. The fault is
Francesco’s, for he is explaining the machine and
making serious errors, and every time he makes a
mistake Paolo gets excited and forgets that he has the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
tripod in his hand, and simply lets it drop. One
senses his acute regret, and at the next moment one
realizes that his scientific zeal, his respect for his profession
of photographer, simply does not permit him
to let a misstatement pass; his gesture as he turns to
set the matter right is so eager, so agonized, that one
doesn’t see what has happened to the tripod until it
has fallen. And to point the moral of the matter,
when the grotesque Alberto after the fifth time picks
the tripod up and attempts to slay Paolo, Paolo is
again turning toward the others and the blow goes
wide.</p>

<p>What the Fratellini are doing here is, to be sure,
what every great actor does—they are presenting
their effects indirectly. The difficulty for them is
that in the end they must give their effects with the
maximum of directness—they have to strike a man in
the face and make the sound tell. In the scene of the
photograph the august is “he who gets slapped” (the
phrase is a common one) and the scene is carefully
built up through his reluctance and stupidity in
posing. At first it is only an exaggeration of the customary
difficulties between a photographer and a
little child; but as the august becomes more and more
suspicious of the intentions of the photographer, the
clowns become more and more insistent that he, and
nobody but he, shall have his picture taken. Gradually
an atmosphere of hostility is built up; the august
tries to escape from the ring and is hauled back; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
dragged, then forced to sit; the opposing wills grow
more and more violent; the audience senses the good
will of the clowns, the obstinacy of the august; not a
push or shove is given without reason and meaning.
And when they see that there is nothing else for it,
the three hurl themselves upon the clown in a frenzy
of destructiveness and he is rent limb from limb. (In
actual fact only his exquisite evening clothes were
rent, but the effect is the same.)</p>

<p>In these scenes and almost all their others, the
Fratellini escape the reproach of being nothing but
violent, while they hold every good element which
violence in action can give them. To them are comparable
the best (and only the best) of Eddie Cantor’s
scenes—when he applied for the job of policeman
and when he was examined for the army—where
there is a play of motive and a hidden logic. In
their world everything must be sensible, and the most
sensible thing in the world is to hit out. Behind
them is a dual tradition—centuries of laughter and
centuries of refining the instruments by which simple
laughter can be produced. For it is opposed to their
sense of fitness (as it is to ours) that the clown should
create an effect of subtlety.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> The kind of laughter
they produce <i>must</i> involve the whole body, but not
the mind. They have to be active all the time, so
that you are dazzled and cannot think; and they must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
shake the solid ground under your feet, so that you
may shake with laughter. What the critical observer
discovers as method must reach the actual average
spectator only as effect. All of this the Fratellini
have accomplished—“these three brothers who constitute
one artist” are the complete and perfect exemplars
of their art. Seeing them sometimes twice a
week, and nearly two dozen times, I find their qualities
inexhaustible. Even in the descriptions of acts
noted above it can be seen that they have a definite
sense of pace; their changes from fast to slow in the
middle of an act, their variations from violence to
trickery, their complete mastery of climax, their fertility
of invention, are all elements of superiority.
But they are only elements in a composition based on
something fundamentally right—the knowledge that
we have almost forgotten how to laugh in the actual
world, and that to make us laugh again they must
create a world of their own.</p>

<p>Only about half of these are heresies, and I am
quite ready to stand by them as I would stand by my
opinion of Dean Swift or Picasso or Henry James or
James Joyce or Johann Sebastian Bach. But I recognize
that they are expressions of personal preference,
and possibly valueless unless related to some general
principles. It appears that what I care for in the catalogue
above falls in the field of the lively arts; and
that the things to which I compare them (for emphasis,
not for measurement) are either second-rate
instances of the major arts or first-rate examples of
the peculiarly disagreeable thing for which I find no
other name than the bogus. I shall arrive presently
at the general principles of the lively arts and their
relation to the major. The bogus is a lion in the
path.</p>

<p>Bogus is counterfeit and counterfeit is bad money
and bad money is better—or at least more effective—than
good money. This is not a private paradox, but
a plain statement of a law in economics (Gresham’s,
I think) that unless it is discovered, bad money will
drive out good. Another characteristic of counterfeit
is that, once we have accepted it, we try to pass it off
on some one else; banks and critics are the only institutions
which don’t—or ought not to—continue the
circulation. In the arts counterfeit is known as <i>faux
bon</i>—the apparently good, essentially bad, which is
the enemy of the good. The existence of the bogus
is not a serious threat against the great arts, for they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
have an obstinate vitality and in the end—but only
in the end—they prevail. It is the lively arts which
are continually jeopardized by the bogus, and it is
for their sake that I should like to see the bogus go
sullenly down into oblivion.</p>

<p>Namely: vocal concerts, pseudo-classic dancing,
the serious intellectual drama, the civic masque, the
high-toned moving picture, and grand opera.</p>

<p>The first thing about them is that a very small
percentage of those who make the bogus arts prosperous
really enjoy them. I recall my own complete
stultification after hearing my first concert; and the
casual way in which I made it evident to all my companions
that I had been to a concert is my only clue
to the mystery. For at bottom there is a vast snobbery
of the intellect which repays the deadly hours
of boredom we spend in the pursuit of art. We are
the inheritors of a tradition that what is worth while
must be dull; and as often as not we invert the maxim
and pretend that what is dull is higher in quality,
more serious, “greater art” in short than whatever is
light and easy and gay. We suffer fools gladly if
we can pretend they are mystics. And the fact that
audiences at concerts and opera, spectators at classic
dances and masques, are suffering, is the final damnation,
for it means that these arts are failures. I do
not found my belief on any theory that all the arts
ought to be appreciated by all the people. I do mean
that most of those who read <i>Ulysses</i> or <i>The Pickwick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Papers</i> do so because they enjoy it, and they stop
the moment they are bored. There is no superiority
in having read a book. The lively anticipation of
delights which one senses in those going to the <i>Follies</i>
or to a circus is wholly absent in the lobby of the
Metropolitan or at a performance of <i>Jane Clegg</i>.
And the art which communicates no ecstasy but that
of snobbism is irretrievably bogus.</p>

<p>There is something hopeless about opera as we
know it in the United States; and the fact that ten
or fifteen operas are among the permanent delights
of civilized existence does not alter the fact. (Three
of them: <i>Chovanstchina</i>, <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>, and
<i>Don Giovanni</i>, are not in the repertoire of the Metropolitan;
nor are <i>Falstaff</i> and <i>Otello</i>; nor does the
ballet proceed beyond <i>Coq d’Or</i>; nor it seems would
the Metropolitan hold it within its dignity to produce
<i>The Mikado</i>, although Schumann-Heink was ready to
sing Katisha.) Here is an art-form hundreds of years
old, prospered by an enormous publicity, favoured by
extraordinary windfalls—the voice of Caruso, the
“personality” of Farrar—able to set into motion nearly
every appeal to the senses in colour, tone, movement—it
has song and action and dance—and what exactly
is the final accomplishment? The pale maunderings
of Puccini, the vulgarity of Massenet, and the
overpowering dulness of our domestic try-outs. Wagner?
A philosopher drunk with divine wisdom is
reported (by Goethe) to have cried out that he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
discern shortcomings even in God; and the melancholy
truth is that the welding of three arts into one
succeeded only in Wagner’s brain, for on the boards
we lose Wagner as we attend to the stage, and regain
him as we return to the music. This is not true of
<i>Boris</i> or of <i>Figaro</i>—so much less pretentious, both;
and the director may arise who will know how to fuse
Wagner into one harmonious and beautiful object.
At the moment, one takes the Metropolitan with its
vast seating capacity, its endless sources of appeal
to the multitude, and one knows that it isn’t a success.
If it isn’t losing money it is paying its way
through social subventions. Eighty per cent of the
music heard there is trivial in comparison with either
good jazz or good symphonic music; ninety per cent
of the acting is preposterous; and the settings, costumes,
and properties are so far below popular musical
comedy standards that in the end Urban and Norman-Bel
Geddes have had to be called in to save
them, and haven’t been given scope or freedom
enough to succeed. The Metropolitan is, I am told,
the finest opera house in the world and loses money
because it is still several leaps ahead of its clientèle
which insists on more Puccini and no <i>Coq d’Or</i>. Also
I have had the supreme pleasure of hearing Chaliapin
there and I am not ungrateful. The Metropolitan
has difficulties happily unknown to us and is unquestionably
an eminent institution. It is opera as we
know it, that calls down the curse, opera which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
to call itself “grand” to distinguish itself from the
popular, superior, kind. For it is pretentious and it
appeals not to our sensibilities but to our snobbery.
It neither excites nor exalts; it does not amuse. Over
it and under it and through it runs the element of
fake; it is a substitute for symphonic music and an
easy expiatory offering for ragtime. <i>Ecrasez l’infâme!</i></p>

<p>Audiences at the opera have, however, been
thrilled by a voice. What is there to say for the uncommunicative,
uninspired, serious-minded intellectual
drama which without wit, or intensity, “presents
a problem” or drearily holds the mirror up to nature?
Those little scenes from domestic life, those second-hand
expositions of other people’s philosophies, those
unflinching grapplings with “the vital facts of existence”
which year by year are held to be great plays?
Let me be frank; let me face my vital facts. I have
never found my brain inadequate to grapple with
their grapplings, for it is almost in the nature of the
case that if a man has anything profound to express
he will flee from the theatre where everything is dependent
upon actors usually unintelligent and is reduced
to the lowest common factor of human intelligence.
Bernard Shaw writes his ideas into his
prefaces because they can’t be fully stated on the
stage; Henry James tried to be delicate and failed.
It remains for Ferencz Molnar and Augustus Thomas
to succeed—with borrowed and diminished ideas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Still speaking of modern serious plays (because the
<i>Medea</i> of Euripides and the tragedy of <i>Othello</i> are
not involved) what is bogus in them is their spurious
appeal to our sentimentality or our snobbery. It is
their pretence to be a great and serious art when they
are simply vulgarizations. I have no quarrel with
any man for the subject matter of his work of art,
and I should allow every freedom to the artist. The
whole trouble with our modern serious drama is that
it is usually such bad drama; the tedium of three
hours of <i>Jane Clegg</i> isn’t worthy sitting through
because of the desperate effort of the dramatist and
the producer to create the illusion of reality by reproducing
the rhythm of reality. The essential distortion,
caricature, or transposition which you find in a
serious work of art or in a vaudeville sketch, is missing
here. And the efforts to ram this sort of play
home by pretending that only morons do not like it
is exactly and precisely bunk. Most plays fail because
they are bad plays; and the greater part of the
intellectual drama following this divine <span class="allsmcap">LAW</span>, fails.
A good manipulator of the theatre like Molnar can
put over <i>Liliom</i>, which has no more of a great idea
than <i>Seven Keys to Baldpate</i> and is almost as good
drama, if he knows in what proportion to mingle his
approaches to our meaner and higher sensibilities.
For we are not altogether lost yet.</p>

<p>If the civic masque and classic dancing continue
much longer we will be lost entirely. These arty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
conglomerations of middle-high seriousness and bourgeois
beauty are not so much a peril as a nuisance.
The former is the “artistic” counterpart of the Elks
Parade and since I cannot speak with decent calm
about its draperies and mummery, I recommend Mr
R. C. Benchley’s chapter on the same subject in <i>Of
All Things!</i> The civic masque is fake mediævalism,
the sort of thing which, if ridicule could kill, should
have gone out after W. S. Gilbert’s couplets appeared
in <i>Patience</i>. Alas the instinct for trumpery
art persists and on it has been grafted the astounding
idea of communal artistic effort—a characteristic
thing, too, for the communal efforts of ancient Greece
were war and Bacchanalia, and of the middle ages,
the crusades; the municipal celebrations after which
the civic masque is patterned were created in cities
which were unself-conscious and were doing something
out of vanity and joy. I cannot imagine the
six million of New York or the six thousand of Vineland,
Arkansas, growing suddenly mad with joy over
the fact that they live in no mean city. I neither
like the civic consciousness nor believe deeply in its
honest existence. And when it takes to expressing
itself as the symbol of the corn and such-like idiocy
it isn’t as funny as the induction scene of the Ziegfeld
Follies (which the Forty-niners took off as “I
am the spirit of Public School Number 146”) and
it isn’t any more moving or intelligent. Certainly
it has never been so beautiful. Faced with the vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
myths of the American pasts, our poets simply haven’t
found the medium for projecting them. The dime
novel and the Wild West film both failed for lack
of imaginative power, and that treasure remains undisturbed.
It is sealed and guarded and the civic
masque nibbles at it, dislodges a fragment, and comes
dancing awkwardly into the foreground waving the
shadow of an illusion like a scarf over its head.</p>

<p>For obviously classic dancing is the natural form
of expression for this pseudo-civism. I have never
had the patience to discover the beginnings of the
fatuous craze for imitations of presumably ancient
dances. Certainly the first of the notable dancers
I saw was not before 1907—in the person of Isadora
Duncan. It would be absurd to recall those renditions
of the <i>Seventh Symphony</i> and what not at this
date. If Miss Duncan is a great artist and a great
personality now, so much the better, for her early
success had much to do with breaking down the gates
of our decent objection to fake and her imitators
swept over us like a flood. Bogus again, these things;
they interpret in dance things which had already
been all too clear in music or drama. They know, it
seems, the science of eurhythmics, which ought to
mean good rhythm, and they employ it to produce in
pantomime an obvious, brutally flat version of the
Fall of Troy. They haven’t as yet added one single
thing to our stock of interest and beauty—as the
Russian Ballet did, as the old five-position ballet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
dance did, as modern ballroom and stage dancing
does. The costuming is almost always silly; the
music chosen is almost always obvious; and the postures
assumed are lethally monotonous. The old
ballet, based on five definite positions, made each
slight variation count, and Pavlowa with her stricken
face and tenderness of movement knew it by heart,
or by instinct. The new dancers have no internal
discipline and no freedom; and only the accident
that the human body is at times not displeasing to
look upon makes them tolerable. One could forgive
them much if the pretensions were not so unutterably
lofty and the swank so ignorant and the results so
ugly. Fat women leaping with chaplets in their
hair, in garments of grey gauze, are not the poetry
of motion, and Irene Castle in a black evening dress
dancing Irving Berlin’s music is—just as surely as
Nijinsky was. What is more, these two dancers,
whom I choose at the extremes of the dance, both
have reference to our contemporary life; and the
classic dancing of Helen Moeller and Marion Morgan
and Mr Chalif and the rest have absolutely nothing
to say to us. We’ve lost that “simplicity,” thank
God, or haven’t found it yet. We are an alert and
lively people—and our dance must actually express
that spirit as no fake can do.</p>

<p>Our existence is hard, precise, high spirited. There
is no nourishment for us in the milk-and-water diet
of the bogus arts, and all they accomplish is a genteel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
corruption, a further thinning out of the blood, a
little extra refinement. They are, intellectually, the
exact equivalent of a high-toned lady, an elegant
dinner or a refined collation served in the saloon,
and the contemporary form of the vapours. Everything
about them is supposed to be “good taste,”
including the kiss on the brow which miraculously
“ruins” a perfect virgin—and they are in the physical
sense of the word utterly tasteless. The great arts
and the lively arts have their sources in strength or
in gaiety—and the difference between them is not
the degree of intensity, but the degree of intellect.
But the bogus arts spring from longing and weakness
and depression.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> A happy people creates folk songs
or whistles rag; it does not commit the vast atrocity
of a “community sing-song”; it goes to Olympic
games or to a race track, to <i>Iphigenia</i> or to Charlie
Chaplin—not to hear a “vocal concert.”</p>

<p>The bogus arts are corrupting the lively ones—because
an essential defect of the bogus is that they
pretend to be better than the popular arts, yet they
want desperately to be popular. They borrow and
spoil what is good; they persuade people by appealing
to their snobbery that they are the real thing.
And as the audience watches these arts in action the
comforting illusion creeps over them that at last they
have achieved art. But they are really watching the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
manifestations of the Great God Bogus—and what
annoys me most is that they might at that very moment
be hailing Apollo or Dionysos, or be themselves
participating in some of the minor rites of the
Great God Pan.</p>

<span class="smcap">Ignorant and Unhappy People</span>:
</p>

<p>The Lord has brought you into a narrow place—what
you would call a tight corner—and you are beginning
to feel the pressure. A voice is heard in the
land saying that your day is over. The name of the
voice is Radio, broadcasting nightly to announce that
the unequal struggle between the tired washerwoman
and the captions written by or for Mr Griffith is
ended. It is easier to listen than to read. And it is
long since you have given us anything significant to
see.</p>

<p>You may say that radio will ruin the movies
no more than the movies ruined the theatre. The
difference is that your foundation is insecure: you
are monstrously over-capitalized and monstrously undereducated;
the one thing you cannot stand is a series
of lean years. You have to keep on going because
you have from the beginning considered the
pictures as a business, not as an entertainment. Perhaps
in your desperate straits you will for the first
time try to think about the movie, to see it steadily
and see it whole.</p>

<p>My suggestion to you is that you engage a number
of men and women: an archæologist to unearth the
history of the moving picture; a mechanical genius
to explain the camera and the projector to you; a
typical movie fan, if you can find one; and above all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
a man of no practical capacity whatever: a theorist.
Let these people get to work for you; do what they
tell you to do. You will hardly lose more money
than in any other case.</p>

<p>If the historian tells you that the pictures you
produced in 1910 were better than those you now
lose money on, he is worthless to you. But if he
fails to tell you that the pictures of 1910 pointed
the way to the real right thing and that you have
since departed from that way, discharge him as a
fool. For that is exactly what has occurred. In
your beginnings you were on the right track; I believe
that in those days you still looked at the screen.
Ten years later you were too busy looking at, or
after, your bank account. Remember that ten years
ago there wasn’t a great name in the movies. And
then, thinking of your present plight, recall that you
deliberately introduced great names and chose Sir Gilbert
Parker, Rupert Hughes, and Mrs Elinor Glyn.
If I may quote an author you haven’t filmed, it shall
not be forgiven you.</p>

<p>Your historian ought to tell you that the moving
picture came into being as the result of a series of
mechanical developments; your technician will add
the details about the camera and projector. From
both you will learn that you are dealing with <i>movement
governed by light</i>. It will be news to you.
You seem not to realize the simplest thing about your
business. Further, you will learn that everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
you need to do <i>must</i> be by these two agencies: movement
and light. (Counting in movement everything
of pace and in light everything which light can make
visible to the eye, even if it be an emotion: do you
recall the unnatural splash of white in a street scene
in <i>Caligari</i>?) It will occur to you that the cut-back,
the alternating exposition of two concurrent actions,
the vision, the dream, are all good; and that the
close-up, dearest of all your finds, usually dissociates
a face or an object from its moving background and is
the most dangerous of expedients. You will learn
much from the camera and from what was done with
it in the early days.</p>

<p>I warn you again they were not great pictures
except for <i>The Avenging Conscience</i> and—one you
didn’t make—<i>Cabiria</i>. To each of these a poet contributed.
(Peace, Mr Griffith; the poet in your case
was E. A. Poe; and the warrior poet of Fiume contributed
the scenario for the second.) Mr Griffith
contrived in his picture to project both beauty and
terror by combining <i>Annabel Lee</i> with <i>The Telltale
Heart</i>. A sure instinct led him to disengage the
vast emotion of longing and of lost love through an
<i>action</i> of mystery and terror. (I think he made a
happy ending somehow—by having the central portion
of his story appear as a dream. How little it
mattered since the <i>real</i> emotion came through the
story.) The picture was projected in a palpable atmosphere;
it was <i>felt</i>. After ten years I recall dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
masses and ghostly rays of light. And if I may anticipate
the end, let me compare it with a picture of
1922, a picturization as you call it, of Annabel Lee.
It was all scenery and captions; it presented a detestable
little boy and a pretty little girl doing æsthetic
dancing along cliffs by the sea; one almost saw the
Ocean View Hotel in the background. Mercilessly
the stanzas appeared on the screen; but nothing was
allowed to <i>happen</i> except a vulgar representation
of calf love. I cannot bear to describe the disagreeable
picture of grief at the end; I do not dare to
think what you may now be preparing with a really
great poem. The lesson is not merely one of taste;
it is a question of knowing the camera, of realizing
that you <i>must</i> project emotion by movement and by
picture combined.</p>

<p>I am trying to trace for you the development of
the serious moving picture as a <i>bogus</i> art, and I can’t
do better than assure you that it was best before
it was an “art” at all. (Or I can indicate that slap-stick
comedy, which you despise, is not bogus, is a
real, and valuable, and delightful entertainment.) I
believe that you went out West because the perpetual
sun of southern California made taking easy;
there you discovered the lost romance of America,
its Wild West and its pioneer days, its gold rush and
its Indians. You had it in your hands, then, to make
that past of ours alive; a small written literature and
a remnant of oral tradition remained for you to work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
on. On the whole you did make a good beginning.
You missed fine things, but you caught the simple
ones; you presented the material directly, with appropriate
sentiment. You relied on melodrama,
which was the rightest thing you ever did. Combat
and pursuit, the last-minute rescue, were the three
items of your best pictures; and your cutting department,
carefully alternating the fight between white
men and red with the slow-starting, distant, approaching,
arriving, victorious troops from the garrison appealed
properly to our soundest instincts. You went
into the bad-man period; you began to make an individual
soldier, Indian, bandit, pioneer, renegade,
the focus of your interest: still good because you related
him to an active, living background. Dear
Heaven! before you had filmed Bret Harte you had
created legendary heroes of your own.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr Griffith, apparently insatiable, was
developing small <i>genre</i> scenes of slum life while
he thought of filming the tragic history of the South
after the war. Other directors sought other fields—notably
that of the serial adventure film. Since they
made money for all concerned, you will not be surprised
to hear these serials praised: <i>The Exploits of
Elaine</i>, the whole Pearl White adventure, the thirty
minutes of action closing on an impossible and unresolved
climax were, of course, infinitely better pictures
than your version of Mr Joseph Conrad’s
<i>Victory</i>, your <i>Humoreske</i>, your <i>Should a Wife Forgive</i>?<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
They were extremely silly; they worked too
closely on a scheme: getting out of last week’s predicament
and into next week’s can hardly be called a
“form.” But within their limitations they used the
camera for all it was worth. It didn’t matter a bit
that the perils were preposterous, that the flights and
pursuits were all fakes composed by the speed of the
projector. You were back in the days of Nick Carter
and the Liberty Boys; you hadn’t heard of psychology,
and drama, and art; you were developing the
camera. You bored us when your effects didn’t come
off and I’m afraid amused us a little even when they
did. But you were on the right road.</p>

<p>There was very little <i>acting</i> in these films and
in the Wild West exhibitions. There was a great
deal of <i>action</i>. I can’t recall Pearl White <i>registering</i>
a single time; I recall only movement, which was excellent.
It was later that your acting developed;
up to this time you were working with people who
hadn’t succeeded in or were wholly ignorant of the
technique of the stage; they moved before the camera
gropingly at first, but gradually developing a technique
suited to the camera and to nothing else. I am
referring to days so far back that the old Biograph
films used to be branded with the mark AB in a circle,
and this mark occurred in the photographed sets to
prevent stealing. In those days your actors and actresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
were exceptionally naïve and creative. You
were on the point of discovering mass and line in the
handling of crowds, in the defile of a troop, in the
movement of individuals. Mr Griffith had already
discovered that four men running in opposite directions
along the design of a figure 8 gave the effect
of sixteen men—a discovery lightly comparable to
that of Velasquez in the crossed spears of the Surrender
of Breda. You would have done well to continue
your experiments with nameless individuals and chaotic
masses; but you couldn’t. You developed what
you called personalities—and after that, actresses.</p>

<p>Before <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> was begun Mary
Pickford had already left Griffith. I have heard that
he vowed to make Mae Marsh a greater actress—as
if she weren’t one from the start, as if acting mattered,
as if Mary Pickford ever could or needed to
act. Remember that in <i>The Avenging Conscience</i>
at least four people: Spottiswood Aiken, Henry Walthall,
Blanche Sweet, and another I cannot identify—the
second villain—<i>played</i> superbly without acting.
Conceive your own stupidity in not knowing what
Vachel Lindsay discovered: that “our Mary” was literally
“the Queen of my People,” a radiant, lovely,
childlike girl, a beautiful figurehead, a symbol of all
our sentimentality. Why did you allow her to become
an actress? Why is everything associated with
her later work so alien to beauty? You did not see
her legend forming; you began to advertise her salary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
you have, I believe unconsciously, tried to restore
her now by giving her the palest rôle in all literature,
that of Marguerite in <i>Faust</i>. You are ten
years too late. In the same ten years Blanche Sweet
has almost disappeared and Mae Marsh has not arrived;
Gishes and Talmadges and Swansons and other
fatalities have triumphed. You have taken over
the stage and the opera; you have filmed Caruso and
Al Jolson, too, for all I know. You now have acting
and no playing.</p>

<p>This is a matter of capital importance and I am
willing to come closer to a definition. Acting is the
way of impersonating, of rendering character, of presenting
action which is suitable to the stage; it has,
in the first place, a specific relation to the size of the
stage and to that of the auditorium; it has also a
second important relation to the lines spoken. Good
actors—they are few—will always suit the gesture
to the utterance in the sense that their gesture will be
on the beat of the words; failure to know this ruined
several of John Barrymore’s soliloquies in <i>Hamlet</i>.
Neither of these two primary and determinant circumstances
affect the moving picture. It should
be obvious that if good acting is adapted to the stage,
nothing less than a miracle could make it also suitable
to the cinema. The same thing is true of opera,
which is in a desperate state because it failed to develop
a type of representation adapted to musical
instead of spoken expression. Opera and the pictures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
both needed “playing”—by which I cover <i>other forms</i>
of representation, of impersonation, characterization,
without identifying them. It is unlikely that opera
and pictures require the same kind of playing; but
neither of them can bear acting. Chaplin, by the way,
is a player, not an actor—although we all think of
him as an actor because the distinction is tardily
made. I should say that Mae Marsh, too, was a
player in <i>The Birth</i>. So was H. B. Warner in a war
play called <i>Shell 49</i> (I am not sure of the figure);
and there have been others. I have never seen Conrad
Veidt or Werner Kraus on the stage; in <i>Caligari</i>
they were players, not actors. Possibly since Kraus
is considered the greatest of German actors, he acted
so well that he seemed to be playing. But that requires
genius and the Gishes have no genius.</p>

<p>The emergence of Mary Pickford and the production
of <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> make the years
1911–14 the critical time of the movies. Nearly all
your absurdities began about this time, including
your protest against the word movies as no longer
suited to the dignity of your art. From the success
of <i>The Birth</i> sprang the spectacle film which was intrinsically
all right and only corrupted Griffith and
the pictures because it was unintelligently handled
thereafter. From the success of Mary Pickford came
the whole tradition of the movie as a genteel intellectual
entertainment. The better side is the spectacle
and the fact that in 1922 the whole mastery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
the spectacular film has passed out of your hands
ought to be sufficient proof that you bungled somewhere.
Or, to drive it home, what can you make of
the circumstance that one of the very greatest successes,
in America and abroad, was <i>Nanook of the
North</i>, a spectacle film to which the producer and the
artistic director contributed nothing—for it was a
picture of actualities, made, according to rumour, in
the interests of a fur-trading company? You will
reply that my assertions are pure theory. It is true
that I have never filmed a scenario in my life. But
as a spectator I am the one who is hard headed and
you the theorists. What I and several million others
know is that something wrong crept into the spectacle
film. We know absolutely that the overblown idea
of <i>Intolerance</i> was foisted on the simple tale of <i>The
Mother and the Law</i>, and that while single episodes
of this stupendous picture were excellent, the whole
failed of effect. In <i>The Birth</i> Mr Griffith had two
stories with no perceptible internal relation, but with
sufficient personal interest to carry; even here not
one person in ten thousand saw the significance of
the highfalutin title. But after the time of <i>Intolerance</i>
Mr Griffith receded swiftly, and his latest pictures
are merely lavish. It is of no significance that
Mr Griffith treats Thomas Burke as though the latter
were a great writer instead of a good scenario writer;
the prettifying of <i>Broken Blossoms</i> was so consistent,
and the fake acting such good fake, that the picture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
almost succeeded. Everywhere Mr Griffith now gives
us excesses—everything is big: the crowds, the effects,
the rainstorms, the ice floes, and everything is
informed with an overwhelming dignity. He has
long ago ceased to create beauty—only beautiful effects,
like set pieces in fireworks. And he was the
man destined by his curiosity, his honesty, his intelligence,
to reach the heights of the moving picture.</p>

<p>It is a hard thing to say, but it is literally true
that something in Mr Griffith has been corrupted
and died—his imagination. <i>Broken Blossoms</i> was a
last expiring flicker. Since then he has constructed
well; I understand that his success has been great;
I am not denying that Mr Griffith is the man to do
<i>Ben-Hur</i>. But he has imagined nothing on a grand
scale, nor has he created anything delicate or fine.
People talk of <i>The Birth</i> as if the battle scenes were
important; they were very good and a credit to Griffith,
who directed, and to George Bitzer, who photographed
them; the direction of the ride of the Klansmen
was better, it had some imagination. And far
better still was a moment earlier in the piece, when
Walthall returned to the shattered Confederate home
and Mae Marsh met him at the door, wearing raw
cotton smudged to resemble ermine—brother and sister
both pretending that they had forgotten their
dead, that they didn’t care what happened. And
then—for the honours of the scene went to Griffith,
not even to the exquisite Mae Marsh—then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
there appeared from within the doorway the arm of
their mother and with a gesture of unutterable loveliness
it enlaced the boy’s shoulders and drew him
tenderly into the house. To have omitted the tears,
to have shown nothing but the arm in that single
curve of beauty, required, in those days, high imagination.
It was the emotional climax of the film;
one felt from that moment that the rape and death of
the little girl was already understood in the vast suffering
sympathy of the mother. So much Mr Griffith
never again accomplished; it was the one moment
when he stood beside Chaplin as a creative artist—and
it was ten years ago.</p>

<p>Of course if Griffith hasn’t come through there
is hardly anything to hope for from the others. Mr
Ince always beat him in advertized expenditure; Fox
was always cheaper and easier and had Annette
Kellerman and did <i>The Village Blacksmith</i>. The
logical outcome of Griffithism is in the pictures he
didn’t make: in <i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>
and in <i>Robin Hood</i>, neither of which I could sit
through. The lavishness of these films is appalling;
the camera runs mad in everything but action, which
dies a hundred deaths in as many minutes. Of what
use are sets by Urban if the action which occurs in
them is invisible to the naked eye? The old trick
of using a crowd as a background and holding the
interest in the individual has been lost; the trick of
using the crowd as an individual hasn’t been found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
because we must have our love story. The spectacle
film is slowly settling down to the level of the stereopticon
slide.</p>

<p>Comparison with German films is inevitable.
They are as much on the wrong track as we are; and
the exception, <i>Caligari</i>, is defective because in a
proper attempt to relieve the camera from the burden
of recording actuality, the producers gave it the
job of recording modern paintings for background.
The acting was, however, playing; and the destruction
of realism, even if it was accomplished by a
questionable expedient, will have much to do with the
future of the film. Yet even in the spectacle film the
Germans managed to do something. <i>Passion</i> and <i>Deception</i>
and the Pharaoh film and the film made out
of <i>Sumurun</i> were not lavish. And in the manipulation
of material (not of the instrument, where we
know much more than they) there came occasionally
flashes of the real thing. In <i>Deception</i> there was a
scene where the courtyard had to be cleared of an
angry mob. Every American producer has handled
the parallel scene and every one in the same way,
centring in the mêlée between civilians and police.
What Lubitsch did was to form a single line of pike
staffs and to show a solid mass of crowd—the feeling
of hostility was projected in the opposition of
line and mass. And slowly the <i>space behind</i> the pike
staffs opened. The bright calm sunlight fell on a
wider and widening strip of the courtyard. One was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
hardly aware of struggle; all one saw was that gradually
broadening patch of open, uncontested <i>space in
the light</i>. And suddenly one knew that the courtyard
was cleared, one seemed to hear the faint murmur
of the crowd outside, and then silence. I am
lost in admiration of this simplicity which involves
<i>every correct principle of the æsthetics of the moving
picture</i>. The whole thing was done with movement
and light—the movement massed and the light on the
open space. That is the true, the imaginative camera
technique, which we failed to develop.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The object of that technique is <i>the indirect communication
of emotion</i>—indirect because that is the
surest way, in all the arts, of multiplying the degree
of intensity. The American spectacle film still communicates
a thrill in the direct way of a highwayman
with a blackjack. But the American serious
film drama communicates not even this: it is at
this moment entirely dead, or in other words, wholly
bogus. I may be wrong in thinking that our present
position develops out of the creation of Mary Pickford
as a star. The result is the same.</p>

<p>For as soon as the movie became “the silent
drama” it took upon itself responsibilities. It had
to be dignified and artistic; it had to have literature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
and actors and ideals. The simple movie plots no
longer sufficed, and stage and novel were called upon
to contribute their small share to the success of an
art which seriously believed itself to be the consummation
of all the arts. The obligation remained to
choose only those examples which were suitable to
the screen. It was, however, not adaptability which
guided the choice, but the great name. Eventually
everything was filmed because what couldn’t be
adapted could be spoiled. The degree of vandalism
passes words; and what completed the ruin was that
good novels were spoiled not to make good films, but
to make bad ones. <i>Victory</i> was a vile film in addition
to being a vulgar betrayal of Conrad; even the
good Molnar with his exciting second-rate play, <i>The
Devil</i>, found himself so foully, so disgustingly
changed on the screen that the whole idea, not a
great one, was lost and nothing remained but a sentimental
vulgarity which had no meaning of its own,
quite apart from any meaning of his. In each of
these the elements are the same: a psychological development
through an action. By corrupting the
action the producers changed the idea; bad enough
in itself, they failed to understand what they were
doing and supplied nothing to take the place of what
they had destroyed. The actual movies so produced
refused to project any consecutive significant action
whatsoever.</p>

<p>It would be futile to multiply examples—as futile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
as to note that there have been well-filmed novels
and plays. The essential thing is that nearly
every picture made recently has borrowed something,
usually in the interest of dignity, gentility, refinement—and
the picture side, the part depending upon
action before the camera, has gone steadily down.
Long subtitles explain everything except the lack of
action. Carefully built scenes are settings in which
nothing takes place. The climax arrives in the masterpieces
of the de Mille school. They are “art.”
They are genteel. They offend nothing—except the
intelligence. High life in the de Mille manner is not
recognizable as decent human society, but it is refined,
and the picture with it is refined out of existence.
Ten years earlier there was another type
of drama: the vamp, in short, and Theda Bara was
its divinity. I have little to say in its defense because
it was unalterably stupid (I don’t say I didn’t
like it). But it wasn’t half so pretentious as the de
Mille social drama, and not half so vulgar. What
it had to say, false or banal or ridiculous, it said entirely
with the camera. It appealed to low passions
and it truckled to imitative morality; there was in
it a sort of corruption. Yet one could resist that
frank ugliness as one can’t resist the polite falsehood
of the new culture of the movies.</p>

<p>It would be easy to exaggerate your failures.
Your greatest mistake was a natural one—in taking
over the realistic theatre. You knew that a photograph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
can reproduce actuality without significantly
transposing it, and you assumed that that was the
duty of the film. But you forgot that the rhythm of
the film was creating something, and that this creation
adapted itself entirely to the projection of emotion
by means <i>not realistic</i>; that in the end the camera
was as legitimately an instrument of distortion
as of reproduction. You gave us, in short, the pleasure
of <i>verification</i> in every detail; the Germans who
are largely in the same tradition—they should have
known better because their theatre knew better—improved
the method at times and counted on significant
detail. But neither of you gave us the pleasure
of <i>recognition</i>. Neither you nor they have taken the
first step (except in <i>Caligari</i>) toward giving us the
highest degree of pleasure, that of escaping actuality
and entering into a created world, built on its
own inherent logic, keeping time in its own rhythm—where
we feel ourselves at once strangers and at
home. That has been done elsewhere—not in the
serious film.</p>

<p>I would be glad to temper all of this with praise:
for Anita Loos’ captions and John Emerson’s occasionally
excellent direction; for George Loane
Tucker, for Monte Katterjohn’s flashes of insight
into what makes a scenario. I have liked many more
films than I have mentioned here. But you are familiar
with praise and there remains to say what you
have missed. The moving picture when it became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
pretentious, when it went upstage and said, “dear
God, make me artistic” at the end of its prayers,
killed its imagination and foreswore its popularity.
At your present rate of progress you will in ten
years—if you survive—be no more a popular art
than grand opera is. You had in your hands an incalculable
instrument to set free the imagination of
mankind—and the atrophy of our imaginative lives
has only been hastened by you. You had also an
instrument of fantasy—and you gave us Marguerite
Clark in films no better than the “whimsy-me” school
of stage plays. Above all, you had something fresh
and clean and new; it was a toy and should have remained
a toy—something for our delight. You gave
us problem plays. Beauty you neither understood
nor cared for; and although you talked much about
art you never for a moment tried to fathom the secret
sources, nor to understand the secret obligations,
of art.</p>

<p>Can you do anything now? I don’t know and I
am indifferent to your future—because there is a future
for the moving picture with which you will have
nothing to do. I do not know if the movie of the
future will be popular—and to me it is the essence
of the movie that it should be popular. Perhaps
there will be a period of semi-popularity—it will be
at this time that you will desert—and then the new
picture will arrive without your assistance. For
when you and your capitalizations and your publicity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
go down together, the field will be left free for
others. The first cheap film will startle you; but the
film will grow less and less expensive. Presently
it will be within the reach of artists. With players
instead of actors and actresses, with fresh ideas
(among which the idea of making a lot of money may
be absent) these artists will give back to the screen
the thing you have debauched—imagination. They
will create with the camera, and not record, and will
follow its pulsations instead of attempting to capture
the rhythm of actuality. It isn’t impossible to recreate
exactly the atmosphere of Anderson’s <i>I’m a
Fool</i>; it isn’t impossible (although it may not be desirable)
to do studies in psychology; it is possible and
desirable to create great epics of American industry
and let the machine operate as a character in the
play—just as the land of the West itself, as the corn
must play its part. The grandiose conceptions of
Frank Norris are not beyond the reach of the camera.
There are painters willing to work in the medium of
the camera and architects and photographers. And
novelists, too, I fancy, would find much of interest
in the scenario as a new way of expression.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> There
is no end to what we can accomplish.</p>

<p>The vulgar prettiness, the absurdities, the ignorances
of your films haven’t saved you. And although
the first steps after you take away your guiding
hand may be feeble, although bogus artists and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
culture-hounds may capture the movie for a time—in
the end all will be well. For the movie is the
imagination of mankind in action—and you haven’t
destroyed it yet.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> was my great fortune just as I was finishing
this book to be taken by a friend to the studio of
Pablo Picasso. We had been talking on our way
of the lively arts; my companion denied none of their
qualities, and agreed violently with my feeling about
the bogus, what we called <i>le côté Puccini</i>. But he
held that nothing is more necessary at the moment
than the exercise of discrimination, that we must be
on our guard lest we forget the major arts, forget
even how to appreciate them, if we devote ourselves
passionately, as I do, to the lively ones. Had he
planned it deliberately he could not have driven his
point home more deeply, for in Picasso’s studio we
found ourselves, with no more warning than our
great admiration, in the presence of a masterpiece.
We were not prepared to have an unframed canvas
suddenly turned from the wall and to recognize immediately
that one more had been added to the small
number of the world’s greatest works of art.</p>

<p>I shall make no effort to describe that painting.
It isn’t even important to know that I am right in my
judgement. The significant and overwhelming thing
to me was that I held the work a masterpiece and
knew it to be contemporary. It is a pleasure to
come upon an accredited masterpiece which preserves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
its authority, to mount the stairs and see the Winged
Victory and <i>know</i> that it is good. But to have the
same conviction about something finished a month
ago, contemporaneous in every aspect, yet associated
with the great tradition of painting, with the indescribable
thing we think of as the high seriousness of
art and with a relevance not only to our life, but to
life itself—that is a different thing entirely. For
of course the first effect—after one had gone away
and begun to be aware of effects—was to make one
wonder whether it is worth thinking or writing or feeling
about anything else. Whether, since the great
arts are so capable of being practised to-day, it isn’t
sheer perversity to be satisfied with less. Whether
praise of the minor arts isn’t, at bottom, treachery
to the great. I had always believed that there exists
no such hostility between the two divisions of
the arts which are honest—that the real opposition
is between them, allied, and the polished fake. To
that position I returned a few days later: it was a
fortunate week altogether, for I heard the <i>Sacre du
Printemps</i> of Strawinsky the next day, and this tremendous
shaking of the forgotten roots of being gave
me reassurance.</p>

</div>

<p>More than that, I am convinced that if one is
going to live fully and not shut oneself away from
half of civilized existence, one must care for both.
It is possible to do well enough with either, and much
depends on how one derives pleasure from them. For
no one imagines that a pedant or a half-wit, enjoying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
a classic or a piece of ragtime, is actually getting
all that the subject affords. For an intelligent human
being knows that one difference between himself
and the animals is that he can “live in the mind”;
to him there need be present no conflict between the
great arts and the minor; he will see, in the end,
that they minister to each other.</p>

<p>Most of the great works of art have reference to
our time only indirectly—as they and we are related
to eternity. And we require arts which specifically
refer to our moment, which create the image of our
lives. There are some twenty workers in literature,
music, painting, sculpture, architecture, and the
dance who are doing this for us now—and doing it
in such a manner as to associate our modern existence
with that extraordinary march of mankind which
we like to call the progress of humanity. It is not
enough. In addition to them—in addition, not in
place of them—we must have arts which, we feel, are
for ourselves alone, which no one before us could have
cared for so much, which no one after us will wholly
understand. The picture by Picasso could have been
admired by an unprejudiced critic a thousand years
ago, and will be a thousand years hence. We require,
for nourishment, something fresh and transient.
It is this which makes jazz so much the characteristic
art of our time and Jolson a more typical
figure than Chaplin, who also is outside of time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
There must be ephemera. Let us see to it that they
are good.</p>

<p>The characteristic of the great arts is high seriousness—it
occurs in Mozart and Aristophanes and
Rabelais and Molière as surely as in Æschylus and
Racine. And the essence of the minor arts is high
levity which existed in the <i>commedia dell’arte</i> and
exists in Chaplin, which you find in the music of
Berlin and Kern (not “funny” in any case). It is a
question of exaltation, of carrying a given theme to
the “high” point. The reference in a great work of
art is to something more profound; and no trivial
theme has ever required, or had, or been able to bear,
a high seriousness in treatment. Avoiding the question
of creative genius, what impresses us in a work
of art is the intensity or the pressure with which the
theme, emotion, sentiment, even “idea” is rendered.
Assuming that a blow from the butt of a revolver is
not exactly artistic presentation, that “effectiveness”
is not the only criterion, we have the beginning of a
criticism of æsthetics. We know that the method
does count, the creativeness, the construction, the
form. We know also that while the part of humanity
which is fully civilized will always care for high
seriousness, it will be quick to appreciate the high
levity of the minor arts. There is no conflict. The
battle is only against solemnity which is not high,
against ill-rendered profundity, against the shoddy
and the dull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

<p>I have allowed myself to catalogue my preferences;
it is possible to set the basis of them down in
impersonal terms, in propositions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That there is no opposition between the great and the lively
arts.</p>

<p>That both are opposed in the spirit to the middle or bogus
arts.</p>

<p>That the bogus arts are easier to appreciate, appeal to low
and mixed emotions, and jeopardize the purity of both the great
and the minor arts.</p>

<p>That except in a period when the major arts flourish with
exceptional vigour, the lively arts are likely to be the most
intelligent phenomena of their day.</p>

<p>That the lively arts as they exist in America to-day are
entertaining, interesting, and important.</p>

<p>That with a few exceptions these same arts are more interesting
to the adult cultivated intelligence than most of the things
which pass for art in cultured society.</p>

<p>That there exists a “genteel tradition” about the arts which
has prevented any just appreciation of the popular arts, and that
these have therefore missed the corrective criticism given to the
serious arts, receiving instead only abuse.</p>

<p>That therefore the pretentious intellectual is as much responsible
as any one for what is actually absurd and vulgar in the
lively arts.</p>

<p>That the simple practitioners and simple admirers of the
lively arts being uncorrupted by the bogus preserve a sure
instinct for what is artistic in America.</p>
</div>

<p>And now a detour around two of the most disagreeable
words in the language: high- and low-brow.
Pretense about these words and what they signify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
makes all understanding of the lively arts impossible.
The discomfort and envy which make these
words vague, ambiguous, and contemptuous need
not concern us; for they represent a real distinction,
two separate ways of apprehending the world, as if
it were palpable to one and visible to the other. In
connexion with the lively arts the distinction is
clear and involves the third division, for the lively
arts are created and admired chiefly by the class
known as lowbrows, are patronized and, to an extent
enjoyed, by the highbrows; and are treated as
impostors and as contemptible vulgarisms by the middle
class, those who invariably are ill at ease in the
presence of great art until it has been approved by
authority, those whom Dante rejected from heaven
and hell alike, who blow neither hot nor cold, the
Laodiceans.</p>

<p>Be damned to these last and all their tribe! There
exists a small number of people who care intensely
for the major and the minor arts and they are always
being accused of “not caring really” for the lively
ones, of pretending to care, or of running away from
“the ancient wisdom and austere control” of Greek
architecture or from the intense passion of Dante,
the purity of Bach, the great totality of what humankind
has created in art. It is claimed, and here the
professional lowbrow agrees, that these others <i>cannot</i>
care for the lively arts, unless they romanticize
them and find things in them which aren’t there—at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
least not for the “real” patrons of those arts—those
who observe them without thinking about them.</p>

<p>Aren’t they there, these secondary qualities? I
take for example a sport instead of an art. Nothing
about baseball interests me except the newspaper
reports of the games, so I speak without prejudice.
In the days of Babe Ruth I took the sun in the bleachers
once and saw that heavy hitter do exactly what
he had to do on his first appearance for the day—a
straight, businesslike home run, much appreciated by
the crowd, as any expert well-timed job is appreciated
by Americans. The game that day went against
the Yankees; they were two runs behind in the ninth,
and with two men on base Ruth came up again.
Again he hit a home run. And the crowd roaring its
joy in victory exhaled two sighs, for the dramatic
quality of the blow and for the lovely spiralling of
the ball in its flight over the fence. “A beauty—a
beauty”—you heard the expression a thousand times—and
“He knows <i>when</i> to hit them.” They would
have roared, too, if he had hit a single, which,
muffed, would have brought in the winning run. But
they would not have said, “a beauty”—and as far as
I am concerned that is proof enough that the appreciation
of æsthetic qualities is universal. It isn’t, thank
Heaven, always put into words.</p>

<p>Take as another instance the fame of the Rath
Brothers. They are acrobats who do difficult things,
but there are others doing much the same sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
thing without approaching the <i>réclame</i> of these two.
Their appearance of ease is a delight; there is no
strain, no swelling muscles, no visible exploitation of
strength. The Hellenic philosopher who held that
the arrow shot from the bow is never in motion, but
at rest from second to second at the succeeding points
of its trajectory, might have seen some ancient forerunners
of these athletes, for each of their movements
seems at once a sculptured rest and a passage into
another pose. And that is precisely the quality which
vaudeville and revue audiences care for, and in a
groping way recognize as distinctive and fine. They
may think that Greeks have been candy-vendors since
the beginning of time and that Marathon was a racecourse;
but they <i>know</i> what they like.</p>

<p>I do not see, therefore, that recognition of these
aspects of the gay arts can in any way detract from
actual enjoyment—on the contrary it adds. You see
Charlie about to throw a mop; the boss enters; without
breaking the line of his movement Charlie swoops
to the floor and begins to scrub. The first, the essential
thing, is the fun in the dramatic turn; but what
makes it funny is that there is no jerk, no break in the
line—the two things are so interwoven that you cannot
separate them. And if anyone were actually entirely
unconscious of the line, the fun would be lost;
it would be Ham and Bud, not Charlie, for such a
spectator. The question is only to what degree one
can be conscious of it—for I have known intellectuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
who so reduced Charlie to angles that the angles no
longer made them laugh. They have done the same
with Massine and Nijinsky; they have followed the
score so closely that they haven’t heard the music
and they correspond exactly to the man who bets on
the game and doesn’t see the play.</p>

<p>The life of the mind is supposed to be a terrible
burden, ruining all the pleasures of the senses. This
idea is carefully supported by “mental workers” (as
they call themselves) and by the brainless. The
truth is, of course, that when the mind isn’t afflicted
by a desire to be superior, it does nothing but multiply
all the pleasures, and the intelligent spectator,
in all conscience, feels and experiences more than
the dull one. To such a spectator the lively arts have
a validity of their own. He cares for them for themselves,
and their relation to the other arts does not
matter. It is only because the place of the common
arts in decent society is always being called into
question that the answer needs to be given. I do not
suppose that my answer is final; but I feel sure that
it must be given, as mine is, from the outside.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span></p>

<p>It happens that what we call folk music, folk
dance, and the folk arts in general have only a precarious
existence among us; the “reasons” are fairly
obvious. And the popular substitutes for these arts
are so much under our eyes and in our ears that we
fail to recognize them as decent contributions to the
richness and intensity of our lives. The result,
strange as it may appear to devotees of culture, is that
our major arts suffer. The poets, painters, composers
who withdraw equally from the main stream of European
tradition and from the untraditional natural expressions
of America, have no sources of strength, no
material to work with, no background against which
they can see their shadows; they feel themselves disinherited
of the future as well as the past.</p>

<p>At the same time the contempt we have for the
lively arts hurts them as much as it hurts us. We
have all heard of the “great artist of the speaking
stage” who will not lower himself by appearing on
the screen; as familiar is the vaudevillian who will
call himself an artist and has hankerings for the
legit; we have seen good dancers become bad actors,
good black-face comedians develop alarming tendencies
toward singing sentimental ballads in whisky-tenor
voices, good comic-strip artists beginning to do
bad book illustrations. The “step upward” is never
in the direction of superior work, but toward a more
rarefied acclaim. They are like a notable novelist
who has for years tried unsuccessfully to write a failure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
because he has only one standard of artistic success:
popularity—but in reverse.</p>

<p>As these artists suffer under opprobrium and try
to avoid it by touching the field of the <i>faux bon</i>,
their work becomes more and more refined and genteel.
The broadness, rough play, vitality, diminish
gradually until a sort of Drama League seriousness
and church-sociable good form are both satisfied.
And all the more’s the pity, for the thinning out of
our lives goes on from day to day and these lively
arts are the only things which can keep us hard and
robust and gay. In America, where there is no recognized
upper class to please, no official academic
requirements to meet, the one tradition of gentility
is as lethal as all the conventions of European society,
and unlike those of Europe our tradition provides
no nourishment for the artist. It is negative all the
way through.</p>

<p>In spite of gentility the lively arts have held to
something a little richer and gayer than the polite
ones. They haven’t dared to be frank, for a spurious
sense of decency is backed by the police, and this limitation
has hurt them; but it has made them sharp
and clever by forcing their wit into deeper channels.
There still exists a broadness in slap-stick comedy
and in burlesque, and once in a while vast figures
of Rabelaisian comedy occur. For the most part the
lively arts are inhibited by the necessity to provide
“nice clean fun for the whole family”—a regrettable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
but inevitable penalty for their universal appeal. For
myself, I should like to see a touch more of grossness
and of license in these arts; it would be a sign
that the blood hadn’t gone altogether pale, and that
we can still roar cheerfully at dirty jokes, when they
are funny.</p>

<p>What Europeans feel about American art is exactly
the opposite of what they feel about American
life. Our life is energetic, varied, constantly changing;
our art is imitative, anæmic (exceptions in both
cases being assumed). The explanation is that few
Europeans see our lively arts, which are almost secret
to us, like the mysteries of a cult. Here the energy
of America does break out and finds artistic expression
for itself. Here a wholly unrealistic, imaginative
presentation of the way we think and feel is accomplished.
No single artist has yet been great
enough to do the whole thing—but together the minor
artists of America have created the American art.
And if we could for a moment stop wanting our
artistic expression to be <i>necessarily</i> in the great arts—it
will be that in time—we should gain infinitely.</p>

<p>Because, in the first place, the lively arts have
never had criticism. The box-office is gross; it detects
no errors, nor does it sufficiently encourage improvement.
Nor does abuse help. There is good
professional criticism in journals like <i>Variety</i>, <i>The
Billboard</i>, and the moving-picture magazines—some
of them. But the lively arts can bear the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
continuous criticism which we give to the major,
and if the criticism itself isn’t bogus there is no reason
why these arts should become self-conscious in
any pejorative sense. In the second place the lively
arts which require little intellectual effort will more
rapidly destroy the bogus than the major arts ever
can. The close intimacy between high seriousness
and high levity, the thing that brings together the
extremes touching at the points of honesty and simplicity
and intensity—will act like the convergence
of two armies to squeeze out the bogus. And the
moment we recognize in the lively arts our actual
form of expression, we will derive from them the
same satisfaction which people have always derived
from an art which was relevant to their existence.
The nature of that satisfaction is not easily described.
One thing we know of it—that it is pure. And in
the extraordinarily confused and chaotic world we
live in we are becoming accustomed to demand one
thing, if nothing else—that the elements presented
to us however they are later confounded with others,
shall be of the highest degree in their kind, of an impeccable
purity.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">“The</span> egregious merit of Chaplin,” says T. S.
Eliot, “is that he has escaped in his own way from
the realism of the cinema and invented a <i>rhythm</i>.
Of course the unexplored opportunities of the cinema
for eluding realism must be very great.”</p>

<p>It amused me once, after seeing <i>The Pawnshop</i>,
to write down exactly what had happened. Later
I checked up the list, and I print it here. I believe
that Chaplin is so great on the screen, his effect so
complete, that few people are aware, afterward, of
how much he has done. Nor can they be aware of
how much of Chaplin’s work is “in his own way”—even
when he does something which another could
have done he adds to it a touch of his own. I do not
pretend that the following analysis is funny; it may
be useful:</p>

<p>Charlot enters the pawnshop; it is evident that
he is late. He compares his watch with the calendar
pad hanging on the wall, and hastily begins to make
up for lost time by entering the back room and going
busily to work. He takes a duster out of a valise
and meticulously dusts his walking-stick. Then
proceeding to other objects, he fills the room with
clouds of dust, and when he begins to dust the electric
fan, looking at something else, the feathers are
blown all over the room. He turns and sees the
plucked butt of the duster—and carefully puts it
away for to-morrow.</p>

<p>With the other assistant he takes a ladder and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
bucket of water and goes out to polish the three balls
and the shop sign. After some horseplay he rises to
the top of the ladder and reaches over to polish the
sign; the ladder sways, teeters, with Charlot on top
of it. A policeman down the street looks aghast, and
sways sympathetically with the ladder. Yet struggling
to keep his balance, Charlot is intent on his
work, and every time the ladder brings him near the
sign he dabs frantically at it until he falls.</p>

<p>A quarrel with his fellow-worker follows. The
man is caught between the rungs of the ladder, his
arms imprisoned. Charlot calls a boy over to hold
the other end of the ladder and begins a boxing
match. Although his adversary is incapable of moving
his arms, Charlot sidesteps, feints, and guards,
leaping nimbly away from imaginary blows. The
policeman interferes and both assistants run into the
shop. By a toss of a coin Charlot is compelled to
go back to fetch the bucket. He tiptoes behind the
policeman, snatches the bucket, and with a wide
swing and a swirling motion evades the policeman
and returns. He is then caught by the boss in another
fight and is discharged.</p>

<p>He makes a tragic appeal to be reinstated. He
says he has eleven children, so high, and so high, and
so high—until the fourth one is about a foot taller
than himself. The boss relents only as Charlot’s
stricken figure is at the door. As he is pardoned,
Charlot leaps upon the old boss, twining his legs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
around his abdomen; he is thrown off and surreptitiously
kisses the old man’s hand. He goes into
the kitchen to help the daughter and passes dishes
through the clothes wringer to dry them—passes a
cup twice, as it seems not to be dry the first time.
Then his hands. The jealous assistant provokes a
fight; Charlot has a handful of dough and is about
to throw it when the boss appears. With the same
motion Charlot flings the dough into the wringer,
passes it through as a pie crust, seizes a pie plate,
trims the crust over it, and goes out to work.</p>

<p>At the pawnshop counter pass a variety of human
beings. Charlot is taken in by a sob story about
a wedding ring; he tries to test the genuineness of
goldfish by dropping acid on them. Sent to the back
room, he takes his lunch out of the safe, gets into
another fight, in which he is almost beating his rival
to death when the girl enters. Charlot falls whimpering
to the floor and is made much of. He returns to
the counter and the episode of the clock begins.</p>

<p>A sinister figure enters, offering a clock in pawn.
Charlot looks at it; then takes an auscultator and
listens to its heart-beat; then taps it over crossed fingers
for its pulmonary action; then taps it with a
little hammer to see the quality, as with porcelain;
then snaps his thumb on the bell. He takes an augur
and bores a hole in it; then a can-opener, and when
he has pried the lid off he smells the contents and
with a disparaging gesture makes the owner smell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
them, too. He then does dentistry on it, with forceps;
then plumbing. Finally he screws a jeweler’s
magnifying glass into his eye and hammers what is
left in the clock, shakes out the contents, measures
the mainspring from the tip of his nose to arm’s
length, like cloth, squirts oil on the debris to keep it
quiet, and, lifting the man’s hat from his head,
sweeps the whole mess into it and returns it with a
sad shake of the head.</p>

<p>A pearl-buyer has meanwhile come in and Charlot
retraces his steps to the back room (carefully stepping
over the buyer’s hat) and begins to sweep. His
broom becomes entangled with a piece of tape, which
fights back and gets longer and longer. Suddenly
Charlot begins to tight-rope upon it, balancing with
the broom, and making a quick turn, coming forward
for applause. A final quarrel with the other assistant
ensues. As they are swarming round the legs of the
kitchen table, the boss comes in and Charlot flees,
leaps into a trunk, and is hidden. As the others enter
the room, the pearl-buyer, who has stolen all the
valuables, holds them up with a revolver. Charlot
leaps from the trunk, fells the robber, and embraces
the lovely maiden for a fade-out.</p>

<p>All of this takes about thirty minutes. I have
put down nearly everything, for Chaplin is on the
scene virtually all of the time. I am fairly certain
that ninety per cent. of this film could not have been
made, even badly, by anyone else. Analysis of <i>A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
Dog’s Life</i> would give the same result: the arrival
at the climax being a little more certain and the
drama of the climax (the curtain scene—compared
with the clock scene above) being more involved in
the course of action.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BANANAS_AND_OTHER_SONGS">“BANANAS” AND OTHER SONGS</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> was not my happiness to have heard <i>Yes; We
Have No Bananas</i> first in America: and to understand
phenomena one must know them in their
natural setting. The phrase itself was created, or
brought to notice, by Tad; as I have said in my
wholly inadequate reference to his work, he is a master
of slang and a creator of it; some acknowledgment
to him might well appear on the cover of the song.
His use of it was immeasurably more delicate and
more amusing than the song, because he used it as
a contradiction of all the blah and high-hat nonsense
in the world; it is in his hands fantastic, funny, and
impertinently pertinent. In the song I can’t see it;
nor am I exceptionally taken with the music, which is
largely synthetic.</p>

<p>However, if I cannot understand the success of
the song (or misunderstand it, for it seems to me to
be “merely” popular) there are those who understand
better. I do not think that my quite secondary
powers of analysis would have risen to the following,
by J. W. T. Mason, correspondent of the London
<i>Daily Express</i>, in New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>New York slang usually changes monthly. Of late there has
been a falling off in inspiration, and picturesque argot culled
from the city’s polyglot interminglings has fallen sadly behind
New York’s quick-witted reputation. At last, however, after
months of waiting a creative effort has been made, and one of
the most effective phrases descriptive of life in New York has
resulted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<p>One hears it on the stage, in the drawing-room, in the kitchen,
on the streets, everywhere: “Yes; we have no bananas.” A song
has been written about it, and is the musical rage of the moment.</p>

<p>Cardboard imitations of bunches of bananas are making their
appearance bearing the legend, “Yes; we have no bananas.”
Business men hang these ornaments in their offices, as a reminder
that, after all, there must be a way out of every difficulty. The
phrase originated in the fruit shops kept in New York by Greeks,
Italians, and Jews, whose knowledge of the English language is
limited in verbiage, but not in volubility, nor in willingness
to try.</p>

<p>These ancient races come to the New World for profit, and
never like to turn a customer away. So they have evolved a
curious positive and negative for the same sentence. Why the
slangmakers hit on bananas has not been discovered. It might
as well have been any other commodity. But the phrase means
that one having asked for bananas in a fruit shop where there
are none, the anxious proprietor, seeking to be ingratiating and
not desiring to displease, answers: ‘Yes; we have no bananas.’
Thereupon he may seek to sell a cabbage or a bunch of beets
instead, since most fruit shops in New York are vegetable establishments
as well.</p>

<p>The phrase is a tribute to the optimism of the newly arrived
immigrant; to his earnest fight to master the language of his
temporary country, and so, somehow, is supposed to take on the
American characteristic of “getting there,” even though by way
of an affirmative in a negative sentence.</p>
</div>

<p>It is, I believe, a generation at least since the
English began to say “Yes I don’t think.” And they
talk about the cable having brought the two countries
closer together. O God! O Montreal!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">I cannot</span> write about Eva Tanguay—not in the
way of Aleister Crowley, at any rate. Here are fragments
from his appreciation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Eva Tanguay! It is the name which echoed in the Universe
when the Sons of the Morning sang together and shouted for
joy, and the stars cried aloud in their courses! I have no words
to hymn her glory, nay, not if I were Shelley and Swinburne and
myself in one—I must write of her in cold prose, for any art of
mine would be but a challenge; I rather make myself passive
and still, that her divine radiance may be free to illumine the
theme. Voco! per nomen nefandum voco. Te voco! Eva veni!</p>

<p>Eva Tanguay is the soul of America as its most desperate
eagle-flight. Her spirit is tense and quivering, like the violin
of Paganini in its agony, or like an arrow of Artemis—it is my
soul that she hath pierced!</p>

<p>The American Genius is unlike all others. The “cultured”
artist, in this country, is always a mediocrity. Longfellow,
Bryant, Emerson, Washington Irving, Hawthorne, a thousand
others, all prove that thesis....</p>

<p>Eva Tanguay is the perfect American artist. She is alone.
She is the Unknown Goddess. She is ineffably, infinitely sublime;
she is starry chaste in her colossal corruption. In Europe
men obtain excitement through Venus, and prevent Venus from
freezing by invoking Bacchus and Ceres, as the poet bids. But
in America sex-excitement has been analyzed; we recognize it
to be merely a particular case of a general proposition, and we
proceed to find our pleasure in the wreck of the nervous system
as a whole, instead of a mere section of it. The daily rush of
New York resembles the effect of Cocaine; it is a universal
stimulation, resulting in a premature general collapse; and Eva
Tanguay is the perfect artistic expression of this. She is Manhattan,
most loved, most hated, of all cities, whose soul is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Delirium beyond Time and Space. Wine? Brandy? Absinthe?
Bah! such mother-milk is for the babes of effete
Europe; we know better. Drunkenness is a silly partial exaltation,
feeble device of most empirical psychology; it cannot compare
with the adult, the transcendental delights of pure
madness.... Why titillate one poor nerve? why not excite
all together? Leave sentiment to Teutons, passion and romance
to Latins, spirituality to Slavs; for us is cloudless, definite,
physiological pleasure!</p>

<p>Eva Tanguay is—exactly and scientifically—this Soul of
America. She steps upon the stage, and I come into formal consciousness
of myself in accurate detail as the world vanishes.
She absorbs me, not romantically, like a vampire, but definitely,
like an anæsthetic, soul, mind, body, with her first gesture. She
is not dressed voluptuously, as others dress; she is like the hashish
dream of a hermit who is possessed of the devil. She cannot
sing, as others sing; or dance, as others dance. She simply
keeps on vibrating, both limbs and vocal chords without rhythm,
tone, melody, or purpose. She has the quality of Eternity; she
is metaphysical motion. She eliminates repose. She has my
nerves, sympathetically irritated, on a razor-edge which is
neither pleasure nor pain, but sublime and immedicable stimulation.
I feel as if I were poisoned by strychnine, so far as my
body goes; I jerk, I writhe, I twist, I find no ease; and I know
absolutely that no ease is possible. For my mind, I am like one
who has taken an overdose of morphine and, having absorbed
the drug in a wakeful mood, cannot sleep, although utterly tired
out. And for my soul? Oh! Oh!—Oh! “Satan prends
pitié de ma longue misère!” Other women conform to the
general curve of Nature, to the law of stimulation followed by
exhaustion; and by recuperation after rest. Not so she, the
supreme abomination of Ecstasy! She is perpetual irritation
without possibility of satisfaction, an Avatar of sex-insomnia.
Solitude of the Soul, the Worm that dieth not; ah, me! She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
is the Vulture of Prometheus, and she is the Music of Mitylene.
She is the one perfect Artist in this way of Ineffable Grace which
is Damnation. Marie Lloyd in England, Yvette Guilbert in
France, are her sisters in art: but they both promise Rest in the
end. The rest of Marie Lloyd is sleep, and that of Yvette
Guilbert death; but the lovers of Eva Tanguay may neither
sleep nor die. I could kill myself at this moment for the wild
love of her....</p>
</div>

<p>And so on—until French intervenes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_KRAZY_KAT_BALLET">THE KRAZY KAT BALLET</h2>
</div>

<p>Mr John Alden Carpenter has been good enough
to permit me to reprint the programme note attached
to his ballet of Krazy Kat, performed Friday, January
20, 1922, at the Town Hall, in New York, and
several times thereafter. The piano transcription of
the score, decorated with many attractive designs by
Herriman, is published. The note is:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To all lovers of Mr Herriman’s ingenious and delightful
cartoons it must have seemed inevitable that sooner or later
Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse would be dragged by some composer
into music. I have tried to drag them not only into music
but on to the stage as well, by means of what I have called, for
obvious reasons, a Jazz Pantomime.</p>

<p>To those who have not mastered Mr Herriman’s psychology
it may be explained that Krazy Kat is the world’s greatest
optimist—Don Quixote and Parsifal rolled into one. It is therefore
possible for him to maintain constantly at white heat a
passionate affair with Ignatz Mouse, in which the gender of each
remains ever a delightful mystery. Ignatz, on the other hand,
condenses in his sexless self all the cardinal vices. If Krazy
blows beautiful bubbles, Ignatz shatters them; if he builds
castles in Spain, Ignatz is there with a brick. In short, he is
meaner than anything, and his complex is cats.</p>

<p>After a few introductory bars the curtain is raised and
Krazy is discovered asleep under a tree. Officer Pup passes,
swinging his club. All is well. Then comes Bill Poster, a canine
relative of Officer Pup, with his bucket and brush, and pastes
upon the wall an announcement of the grand ball which will
shortly be given for all the animals. The job finished, Bill
departs.</p>

<p>Krazy wakes up; he rubs his eyes and reads the exciting
poster. He is moved to try his steps; he finds his feet heavy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
and numerous. Of a sudden he spies on a clothes line which
the moving scenery has brought into view, a <i>ballet skirt</i>. Undoubtedly
it is his costume for the ball. He approaches the
clothes line, first with restraint, then with eagerness. He
snatches the skirt from the line, claps it on, and comes bounding
forward in high abandon.</p>

<p>He is interrupted by the appearance of Old Joe Stork,
drilling by with his bundle on his back. He passes on, but he
has carelessly dropped his pack. Krazy sniffs at it, filled with
curiosity. He picks it up and carries it triumphantly to his tree
in the corner. He opens the bundle, and finds that it contains
not what you thought it would, but a vanity case, mirror, rouge,
powder-puff, lip-stick and all, complete, including a beautiful
pair of white cotton gloves.</p>

<p>He abandons himself to the absorbing task of make-up for
the ball. Meanwhile the moving scenery has brought into view
the house of Ignatz Mouse. The door opens, and Ignatz’ head
appears. Opportunity has knocked. The Mouse steals forward
and is about to seize an inviting brick when Officer Pup (thank
heaven!) arrives in the very nick of time and drives him from
the scene. The unsuspecting Kat, in the meantime, has completed
his make-up. He now arises, draws on his white cotton
gloves, and then by way of further preparatory exercise, he
indulges in a bit of a Spanish dance.</p>

<p>At its conclusion Krazy is suddenly confronted by the <i>Mysterious
Stranger</i>. The sophisticated audience will observe that
it is none other than Ignatz disguised as a catnip merchant.
Very formidable indeed! The Stranger steps briskly forward
and holds out to the ever-receptive Kat a bouquet—an enormous
bouquet of catnip. Krazy plunges his nose into the insidious
vegetable, inhales deeply to the very bottom of his lungs, and
then goes off at once into what Mr Herriman calls a <i>Class A fit</i>.
It is a fit progressive, a fit <i>de luxe</i>, the Katnip Blues, in which
the wily Ignatz joins as additional incitement. When the frenzy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
has achieved its climax, the Mouse throws off his disguise, seizes
his brick, dashes it full in the face of the Kat, and escapes.
Krazy staggers back, stunned and exhausted, but yet undaunted.
There is the moment of ecstatic recognition—Ignatz Dahlink—as
he totters and reels back to his little tree. He sinks down
wearily under its protecting boughs. The moon comes out.
Krazy sleeps. Krazy dreams. Indominatable Kat!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FURTHER_NOTE_ON_THE_FRATELLINI">FURTHER NOTE ON THE FRATELLINI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> Fratellini are so ingenious and so full of surprises
that it is useless to try to keep up with them.
I have seen them a dozen times since first writing
about them, sometimes three times in a week with a
still growing delight. Some of the stunts demand to
be mentioned. There is one as good as the photographer—it
is based on the idea that a saxophone
player who cannot play the saxophone, is engaged
because he has a starving family; another, concealed
in a box, does the actual playing in the test before
the manager of the house. The complications can
easily be guessed; but it is impossible to guess the
combination of delicacy and uproariousness with
which they are rendered. At the end of this act Alberto,
the grotesque with the square painted windows
over his eyes, hides in a sack and you have one of the
everlasting sources of children’s humour carried to its
supreme conclusion. Still another stunt is a dancing
act, first as a burlesque of ballet, and then as a
straight tango, with Francesco as a rather wicked old
dowager in a green dress, and Alberto with complete
facial make-up, but otherwise extremely chic, dancing
exquisitely. Finally, I mention another entrance,
superior to the one described in the text. Francesco,
very much the English gentleman, arrives on the
scene, followed by his two servants, Paulo and Alberto,
the former with a ludicrous exaggeration of the
Englishman’s travelling rug, the latter with a wicker
hamper of unimaginable proportions. As these two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
stagger after their master he tries to get out, as if he
had come into the wrong place. Finally he addresses
himself to an attendant, at the same time ordering
his servants to drop their impedimenta. Before these
two have time to light cigarettes, Francesco is off
again, they must lift the huge burdens and follow
him; again he orders them to discharge and enters
into conversation; and this goes on until it works
itself into a fury, the master always walking in one
direction while the servants are so far behind him that
they are walking in the opposite one. The human
basis of the event, the skill with which it is done, and
the intensity of it, are combined to make a miracle.
At the end Alberto is so exhausted that he sees visions
and begins to fight a duel with his own shadow; he
leaps back, guards, and finally falls upon it and beats
it to death.</p>

<p>It may not be inappropriate to mention here the
name of another clown also appearing, although not
regularly, at the Medrano. He is one of the three
Oréas, the other two being quite exceptional acrobats
on the trapeze. The clown Oréas does not create as
the Fratellini do; he parodies acrobatics and uses an
amazingly physical adaptability for immense fun. To
be sure he falls off and on the bars; but he is also
capable of mounting a ladder in a series of march
steps, and of missing the support, as he swings from
the bar, sliding round it with his arm on the upright,
and slipping down on his bottom, in a movement of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
great grace. His little trick of taking a glass full of
beer out of his pocket at the end of each tumble is
not new, but he does it extremely well, and he has
the sense of gait as well as the sense of costume and
impression.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> begins to look as if we will have to find a new
explanation for the French. Since that would be
difficult, I suggest that we hold fast to the old one,
with variations. Let us continue to say that they
are moribund and explain any outburst of activity as
a death struggle. The last gasp. History provides
plenty of precedent, and we who find pleasant things
in their art and letters will rank ourselves with those
cultivated persons who cannot begin to care for Latin
until it becomes a highly corrupt language.</p>

<p>I do not know whether seeing new opportunities
and developing them quickly are the best signs of
degeneracy, for I seem to remember reading about
these things in the advertisements, where nothing as
irrevocable as degeneracy is permitted. The adaptability
of the moving picture scenario to something besides
moving pictures was a thing easy to guess;
the thing has been done in both America and
England in burlesque of the films—an adaptation
requiring and receiving very little intelligence.</p>

<p>It may be slightly beside the point, but it is interesting
to note that the cinema influence in literature
in France is almost exactly opposite to what it is
here. There it seems to make for brevity, hardness,
clarity, brilliance. You will find it in the extraordinary
stories of Paul Morand and Louis Aragon; and
you will find in neither of these those characteristic
sloppinesses which American authors are beginning to
blame on the movies. If they would take the trouble<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
of studying the pictures, instead of trying to make
money out of them, and discover the elements in the
cinema technique which are capable of making their
own work fruitful, we might have better novels, and
we certainly would have a few less bad pictures.</p>

<p>Two Frenchmen have, at the same time, used the
scenario as a method of fiction, and each of them has
written a highly ironic piece which is capable of being
transferred to the film, but which reads sufficiently
well to be considered as an end in itself.</p>

<p>Blaise Cendrars, poet, responsible for the <i>Anthologie
Nègre</i>, is the author of <i>La Fin du Monde</i> and of
<i>La Perle Fièvreuse</i>; the second of these is running as
a serial in a Belgian magazine, <i>Signaux</i>. Both are
called Novels; the third instalment of <i>The Pearl</i>
adding the word cinematographic. <i>The End of the
World</i> is a cosmic cinema-novel in fifty-five swift,
concisely told scenes.</p>

<p>It deals with a sort of deity, resident on a planet
accessible to all the mechanical comforts of this earth,
who is induced to travel to Mars as a propagandist
for his own religion. Like many propagandists he
errs in his psychology and, in a Billy Sunday frenzy
of the imagination, shows the Martians all the cruelties
his religion is capable of. Too late he learns that
“the Martians are disillusioned and confirmed pacifists,
iodophages living on the peptonic vapours of
human blood, but incapable of bearing the sight of
the least cruelty.” The mission failing, he decides to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
make good on certain prophecies uttered in his name.
The following scenes are left a little in the air; continuity
is lacking. One begins again with the sculptured
angel on Notre Dame blowing a blast on her
trumpet and the whole world rushing towards Paris
and crumbling into dust. Thereafter, with the aid of
retarded and accelerated projection, we see the world
slowly dissolving into its elements, through those
stages so graphically presented to us by H. G. Wells.
There is chaos, and then annihilation.</p>

<p>And then, by an accident in the projection room,
the film begins to reverse and so, naturally, one
gropes upward out of the slime and returns to the first
scene—to which is added the single phrase “It’s bankruptcy.”
It opens with the deity “at his American
(roll-top) desk. He hastily signs innumerable letters.
He is in his shirt sleeves with a green eye-shade
on his forehead. He rises, lights a big cigar, looks
at his watch, strides nervously up and down the room....
He makes notes on his pad and blows away
the ash which falls from his cigar between the leaves.
Suddenly he snatches the telephone and begins to
’phone furiously....”</p>

<p>That is American movie technique which M Cendrars
has evidently learned all too well, because he
uses it, in all its tedious detail, in <i>La Perle Fièvreuse</i>,
for which he is publishing not a scenario but a
director’s script, with the cutbacks and visions and
close-ups all numbered and marked. It is in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
manner of the old Biograph movies with what may
turn out to be not such innocent fun at the expense
of the detective film. Among its characters are Max
Trick, director of Trick’s Criminal Courier, the great
daily which specializes in criminal news. He is
marked “Type: le President Taft” and is first shown
in his office with twenty-five telephones in front of
him; among his collaborators are Nick Carter and
Arsène Lupin, Conan Doyle and Maurice Leblanc.</p>

<p>What Jules Romains has accomplished is much
more remarkable, for he has pushed the method of
the cinema forward a long and significant step, and,
while using everything it can give, he has produced
a first class work of fiction. The plot of <i>Donogoo-Tonka</i>
you will see at once, is entirely suitable to
filming; it is not perhaps suitable to commercial success,
but that can be, if it isn’t, another matter.</p>

<p>It begins in Paris with the unfortunate Lamendin,
who is about to commit suicide. A friend gives him
a card with the legend: “Before committing suicide
... don’t fail to read the other side,” and on the
reverse is the advertisement of Professor Miguel
Rufisque, director of the Institute of Biometric Psychotherapy,
who guarantees to give you, within seven
days, a violent love of life. Lamendin goes to the
consulting room and after a fantastic examination is
given certain instructions which eventually land him
in the library of Prof. Yves Trouhadec, a geographer.
Trouhadec would be certain of election to the Geographic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Institute if he hadn’t, many years before,
placed on a map of South America the wholly imaginary
town of Donogoo-Tonka, in the gold-mining
area. Lamendin now proposes to float a company,
start an expedition, and insure the Professor’s election
by actually creating the place.</p>

<p>In the second reel Donogoo-Tonka is launched; in
the third we have adventurers in all parts of the
world preparing to rush the gold fields, while Lamendin
tarries at home making fake moving pictures of
the place. At the end of the reel the adventurers
have penetrated into the heart of the South American
desert and, too wearied to go forward, aware of the
deception practised upon them, encamp where they
are. Derisively they call the place Donogoo-Tonka.</p>

<p>Later, a second group of adventurers comes.
They are disappointed in the look of the place. But
they are interested to hear that gold is being found;
and while Lamendin at last sets sail, the Donogoo-Tonka
Central Bar and the London &amp; Donogoo-Tonka’s
Splendid Hotel are going up; it is obviously
the intention of the earlier arrivals to mulct the later.</p>

<p>And then, of course, gold really is found in the
river bed and the price of all provisions goes up fifty
per cent.</p>

<p>Regrettably, <i>en voyage</i>, Lamendin tells his
pioneers that Donogoo does not exist. On his arrival
at Rio de Janeiro he receives a cable from the Professor,
demanding immediate results; and as he turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
in despair he reads the announcement by Agence
Meyer-Kohn, of the next caravan to the gold fields
of Donogoo-Tonka. He arrives; he takes possession;
he founds an empire, in which the religion of Scientific
Error is established. Trouhadec, still living, is
deified; he becomes Trouhadec, Father of his Country.
The utility of geography is one of the prescribed subjects
for public lectures.</p>

<p>That is a slightly more intelligent plot than most
of the adventure things one sees in the movies. It
is in the detail and in the presentation of an <i>idea</i>, the
idea of scientific error, that M Romains has pressed
beyond the professional technique of the moving picture
without once exceeding its natural limitations.
For instance in the waiting room where Lamendin sits
with the other would-be suicides:</p>

<p>“Absurdity, given off by so many brains, becomes
palpable. One begins to distinguish a sort of very
subtle exhalation which disengages itself from the
human bodies and little by little charges the atmosphere.”
The settings in this scene are very much
in the manner of <i>Caligari</i>. Or there is the debate in
the soul of Professor Trouhadec who knows that he
will profit by a fraud. From the beginning the spectator
must realize that the debate is only on the surface;
that in his heart Trouhadec is going to accept;
the spectator is to see him thinking of truth with a
capital T and, much deeper down, of himself as a
member of the Institute. Just as in the exploitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
of Donogoo-Tonka we see a man coming up the steps
of a subway station with the words Donogoo-Tonka
written on every step; until, as he emerges, his skull
ceases to be opaque, and we see the twelve little letters
dancing in his brain. M Romains has even carried
the thing over into Keystone farce, so sure is he
of his medium. During one of the lectures “his eloquence
is so persuasive, his thought opens such
penetrating channels into human nature that, little
by little, little by little, a soft down begins to sprout
on the bald head” of a man in the audience. <i>Ça c’est
du Cinema</i>, as M Cendrars says.</p>

<p>M Romains has also a complete understanding
of projection. He protests, in a preface, against the
monotonous speeding-up of pictures and urges that
this one be taken and shown in the rhythm of ordinary
life, with a shading toward slow, especially in
the scenes “where the only events which pass before
us are the thoughts of the characters” (required reading
for Mr Griffith and Mr de Mille for one year is
in those words). In the scenes which exploit the
shares in Donogoo-Tonka we enter into the minds of
individuals, of groups, of crowds; at the end the very
framework of a building succumbs to the madness of
the idea. And then, with a technical mastery not yet
put into practise, M Romains directs that the various
scenes just projected be shown again, side by side,
with a gradually accelerated rhythm. In the scenes
of the adventurers we get glimpses at Marseilles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
London, Naples, Porto, Singapore, San Francisco;
then we see the groups starting out; the lines of their
voyage converge. These scenes are projected first in
succession and then <i>simultaneously</i>. Each time we
see them we recognize some of the individuals we
have seen before. “And when by chance the faces
are turned towards us, we have a feeling that they,
too, recognize us.” The cinema has not yet accomplished
that; chiefly, I fancy, because it never has
been asked to.</p>

<p>M Romains is the prophet of <i>unanisme</i>, and it
would be remarkable if he did not use the moving
picture to push his point. The end of Donogoo-Tonka
is pure poetry.</p>

<p>The horizon has receded before the Palace and
the chief figures look out into a light which has its
own laws. Paris appears deep in the background.
“But so close, perhaps, that we are troubled to see it
and would like to fall back a step.</p>

<p>“As if, yielding to friendly pressure, the world
has renounced for one evening its concept of space
and all its habits.”</p>

<p><span class="firstword">I owe</span> so much to others in connexion with this
book that if I were to set down the names and the
reasons it would appear, quite properly, that I have
done little except collect and theorize about material
presented to me; it might also appear that I wish to
make others responsible. Virtually everyone I know
has contributed something—and in many cases they
did so before I had thought of writing this book. I
can therefore make only specific acknowledgments.
Above all to two managing editors, John Peale
Bishop and Edmund Wilson, Jr., of <i>Vanity Fair</i>
and to their editor, Frank Crowninshield; they published
several essays which later served as the raw
material for chapters here, published portions of
other chapters written expressly for this book, and
otherwise encouraged and prospered me—to such an
extent that I owe to them and to my fellow-editors
of the <i>Dial</i> the holiday which made it possible for
me to write at all. Except as otherwise acknowledged,
the illustrations are reproduced with the permission
of the artists; in addition, I have to thank the
editors of the two journals mentioned for joining
their permission in the case of work they originally
reproduced, the firm of Albert and Charles Boni for the
liberal use of Frueh’s Stage Folk, and H. T. Parker of
the Boston <i>Transcript</i> for letting me reprint <i>A Conversation
in Old Athens</i>. For technical information and
exceptionally painstaking criticism I am indebted to
Sara and Gerald Murphy, Martin Brown, Alexander<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Steinert, Deems Taylor, Lewis Galantière, H. K. Moderwell,
and Dorothy Butler; for the material in the
appendix to Charles Chaplin, Irving Berlin, Bushnell
Dimond, Walter Hoban, and Sophie Wittenberg. My
indebtedness to those whom I do not know—those I
have written about—is too apparent to need emphasis,
and too great to be adequately acknowledged.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> This review appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i> sometime in the summer of
1922. I allow it to stand with nothing more than verbal corrections in
spite of my dislike of books which collect articles expressly written for
magazine publication, because I feel that the negro show is extraordinarily
transient and that a transient criticism of it is adequate. The
permanent qualities are touched on elsewhere; especially in the essay
entitled “Toujours Jazz.” Since this was written there have been other
negro shows, and I have heard that one was better than <i>Shuffle Along</i>.
What has interested me more is the report that there is a “nigger show
by white men” which is standing them up every night. This verifies a
prediction made below—that the negro show would have an effect on the
white man’s. I am not at all sure that there will not continue to be negro
shows for a long time—why in Heaven’s name shouldn’t there be? They
have their qualities and their great virtues. It is only in relation to the
sophisticated Broadway piece that I find them lacking; and have perhaps
not been fair enough to them.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> A footnote to a footnote is preposterous. Perhaps the very excess
of its obscurity will give it prominence and render faint justice to the
old New York <i>Hippodrome</i>. It is a fine example of handling of material,
and of adjustment, spoiled occasionally by too much very loud singing
and a bit of art. It is part of New York’s small-townness; but it is so
vast in its proportions that it can never acquire the personal following
of a small one-ring circus like the Medrano in Paris. I adore the
<i>Hippodrome</i> when it is a succession of acts: the trained crow and Ferry
who plays music on a fence and the amazing mechanical and electrical
effects. Joe Jackson, one of the greatest of clowns, played there, too,
and had ample scope. I like also the complete annihilation of personality
in the chorus. When you see three hundred girls doing the same thing
it becomes a problem in mass—I recall one instance when it was a mass
of white backs with black lines indicating the probable existence of
clothes—the whole thing was quite unhuman. And one great scene in
which, I believe, the whole of the personnel participated: there were, it
seemed, hundreds of tumblers and scores of clowns, and a whole toy
shop in excited action. Oddly enough, one finds that the weakness of
the <i>Hip</i> is in its humour; there is plenty of it, but it is not concentrated,
and there is no specific <i>Hippodrome</i> “style.” What it will become under
the new Keith régime remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions
of this eBook that support hyperlinks, the page
references in the List of Illustrations lead to the
corresponding illustrations.</p>

<p>Halftone patterns in some illustrations could not
be entirely obscured.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been
collected, renumbered, and placed just before the Index.</p>

<p>The index was not checked for proper alphabetization
or correct page references. It was not always
possible to determine whether or not some
references were in boldface.</p>

<p>“Strawinsky” is spelled that way throughout this book.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_209">Page 209</a>: “surexcess” was printed that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_219">Page 219</a>: “gettings” was printed that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_379">Page 379</a>: “Indominatable” was printed that way.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_395">Page 395</a>: “Cæsar, Irving” was mispelled here, but
spelled correctly on the referenced page.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
